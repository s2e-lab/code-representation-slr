Nowadays, the mainstream vulnerability detection methods mainly transform source code into an intermediate representation and then detect it by machine learning or deep learning algorithms, but the problem of high false-positive rate and negative rate is difficult to solve. This is mainly because the intermediate representation does not reflect the characteristics of the vulnerabilities well. In this paper, we propose a convolutional neural network-based feature extraction model. By extracting features from such intermediate representations of code metrics, these features are used as input to a deep learning model for vulnerability detection. By experimenting with other vulnerability detection methods under the same benchmark, our proposed model shows improvement in all evaluation metrics, with Precision and Recall reaching close to 80%, and False Positive Rate and False Negative Rate decreasing to close to 20%.

SQLI attacks provide opportunities by malicious actors to exploit the data, particularly client personal data. To counter these attacks security measures need to be deployed at all layers, namely application layer, network layer, and database layer; otherwise, the database remains vulnerable to attacks at all levels. Research studies have demonstrated that lack of input validation, incorrect use of dynamic SQL, and inconsistent error handling have continued to expose databased to SQ LI attacks. The security measures commonly deployed presently, being mostly focused on the network layer only, still leave the program code and the database at risk despite well-established approaches such as web server requests filtering, network firewalls and database access control.

We address these gaps in the prior research by proposing SCEVD: a deep learning model for vulnerability discovery which utilises semantic information to intelligently select features in source code graphs for learning. It uses information contained within code graph nodes, as well as information about their relationships with one another to select the code graph features which are most relevant to code vulnerability.

Source code static analysis has been used extensively to detect the unintentional defects, i.e. vulnerabilities, introduced into the source codes by software developers. In this paper, we propose a deep learning approach to detect vulnerabilities from their LLVM IR representations based on the techniques that have been used in natural language processing. The proposed approach uses a hierarchical process to first identify source codes with vulnerabilities, and then it identifies the lines of codes that contribute to the vulnerability within the detected source codes. This proposed two-step approach reduces the false alarm of detecting vulnerable lines.

In addition, when manufacturers release patches, they generally hide the exact location of the vulnerabilities. So, identifying vulnerabilities in binaries is crucial. However, just searching source program has a lower identifying accuracy of vulnerability, which requires operators further to differentiate searched results. Under this context, we propose VMPBL to enhance identifying the accuracy of vulnerability with the help of patch files. VMPBL, compared with other proposed schemes, uses patched functions according to its vulnerable functions in patch file to further distinguish results. We establish a prototype of VMPBL, which can effectively identify vulnerable function types and get rid of safe functions from results. Firstly, we get the potential vulnerable-patched functions by binary comparison technique based on K-Trace algorithm. Then we combine the functions with vulnerability and patch knowledge database to classify these function pairs and identify the possible vulnerable functions and the vulnerability types. Finally, we test some programs containing real-world CWE vulnerabilities, and one of the experimental results about CWE415 shows that the results returned from only searching source program are about twice as much as the results from VMPBL.

A practical approach to predicting vulnerable code would enable them to prioritize security auditing efforts. In this paper, we propose using a set of hybrid (static+dynamic) code attributes that characterize input validation and input sanitization code patterns and are expected to be significant indicators of web application vulnerabilities. Because static and dynamic program analyses complement each other, both techniques are used to extract the proposed attributes in an accurate and scalable way. Current vulnerability prediction techniques rely on the availability of data labeled with vulnerability information for training. For many real world applications, past vulnerability data is often not available or at least not complete. Hence, to address both situations where labeled past data is fully available or not, we apply both supervised and semi-supervised learning when building vulnerability predictors based on hybrid code attributes. Given that semi-supervised learning is entirely unexplored in this domain, we describe how to use this learning scheme effectively for vulnerability prediction. We performed empirical case studies on seven open source projects where we built and evaluated supervised and semi-supervised models. When cross validated with fully available labeled data, the supervised models achieve an average of 77 percent recall and 5 percent probability of false alarm for predicting SQL injection, cross site scripting, remote code execution and file inclusion vulnerabilities. With a low amount of labeled data, when compared to the supervised model, the semi-supervised model showed an average improvement of 24 percent higher recall and 3 percent lower probability of false alarm, thus suggesting semi-supervised learning may be a preferable solution for many real world applications where vulnerability data is missing.",1941-0018,,10.1109/TDSC.2014.2373377,"National Research Fund, Luxembourg(grant numbers:FNR/P10/03);",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6963442,Vulnerability prediction;security measures;input validation and sanitization;program analysis;empirical study;Vulnerability prediction;security measures;input validation and sanitization;program analysis;empirical study,Computer security;Data models;Semisupervised learning;HTML;Servers;Software protection;Predictive models,Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);program diagnostics;security of data,Web application vulnerability prediction;hybrid program analysis;machine learning;vulnerable code identification;vulnerable code prediction;security auditing;hybrid static+dynamic code attributes;input validation code patterns;input sanitization code patterns;static program analyses;dynamic program analyses;vulnerability prediction techniques;semisupervised learning;vulnerability predictors;open source projects;false alarm probability;SQL injection;cross site scripting;remote code execution;file inclusion vulnerabilities,,76.0,1.0,51.0,IEEE,20 Nov 2014,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals,False,False,False,

However, it is confusing to explain how a deep learning model makes decisions on the prediction, although such a model achieves a good performance. Meanwhile, it is also difficult to discover which part of the source code is concentrated on by this black-box model. To this end, we present an empirical evaluation to explore how the deep learning model works on predicting vulnerability and whether it precisely captures the critical code segments to represent the vulnerable patterns. First of all, we build a new vulnerability dataset, called Juliet+, in which vulnerability-related code lines of both positive (bad) and negative (good) samples are labeled manually with substantial efforts, based on the Juliet Test Suite. After that, four deep learning models by leveraging attention mechanisms are empirically implemented to detect vulnerability through mining vulnerable patterns from the source code. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of such four models and to analyze the interpretability with evaluation metrics such as Hit@k. The empirical experiment results reveal that the deep learning models with attention, to some extent, can focus on the vulnerability-related code segments that are profitable to interpret the result of vulnerability detection, especially when we adopt the graph neural network model. We further investigate what factors affect the interpretability of models including the class distribution, the number of samples, and the differences of sample features.

Meanwhile, there are some differences between vulnerable functions and non-vulnerable functions in the code property graph. Therefore, this article proposes a vulnerability detection solution named VULMG, which converts vulnerability detection into the graph classification problem. VULMG includes a vectorization component named VecG and a deep learning classification model named MGGAT. Based on the code property graph, VecG extracts the lexical, grammatical, and semantic information of the source code as a feature matrix and extracts information such as structure, control, and dependence as three adjacency matrices. MGGAT is a deep learning model based on the graph attention network, which is used for graph classification. Besides, VULMG uses the FCG to associate the calling function with the called function so that it can detect the cross-function vulnerabilities.

Secondly, we propose an effective data representation method to retain more semantic information.

To improve the effectiveness and efficiency of vulnerability detection, many traditional machine learning-based and deep learning-based vulnerability detection methods have been proposed. However, the impact of different factors on vulnerability detection is unknown. For example, classification models and vectorization methods can directly affect the detection results and code replacement can affect the features of vulnerability detection. We conduct a comparative study to evaluate the impact of different classification algorithms, vectorization methods and user-defined variables and functions name replacement. In this paper, we collected three different vulnerability code datasets. These datasets correspond to different types of vulnerabilities and have different proportions of source code. Besides, we extract and analyze the features of vulnerability code datasets to explain some experimental results. Our findings from the experimental results can be summarized as follows: (i) the performance of using deep learning is better than using traditional machine learning and BLSTM can achieve the best performance. (ii) CountVectorizer can improve the performance of traditional machine learning. (iii) Different vulnerability types and different code sources will generate different features.

These risks are often quantified by performing dynamic analysis and permission analysis of the Android applications after release. Prediction of security and privacy risks associated with Android applications at early stages of application development, e.g. when the developer (s) are writing the code of the application, might help Android application developers in releasing applications to end-users that have less security and privacy risk. The goal of this paper is to aid Android application developers in assessing the security and privacy risk associated with Android applications by using static code metrics as predictors. In our paper, we consider security and privacy risk of Android application as how susceptible the application is to leaking private information of end-users and to releasing vulnerabilities. We investigate how effectively static code metrics that are extracted from the source code of Android applications, can be used to predict security and privacy risk of Android applications. We collected 21 static code metrics of 1,407 Android applications, and use the collected static code metrics to predict security and privacy risk of the applications. As the oracle of security and privacy risk, we used Androrisk, a tool that quantifies the amount of security and privacy risk of an Android application using analysis of Android permissions and dynamic analysis. To accomplish our goal, we used statistical learners such as, radial-based support vector machine (r-SVM). For r-SVM, we observe a precision of 0.83.

Traditional static analysis techniques cannot exhaustively enumerate all unsafe modes, and problems such as low path coverage rate brought by dynamic detection techniques make software security vulnerability detection inefficient. Methods based on Natural Language Processing have promoted the research of code defect detection tasks; however, there are problems of insufficient code semantic learning and limited data processing by pre-trained models. To solve these problems, from the perspective of enriching model input semantics and improving the model’s ability to process data, based on the Transformer model, we propose a hierarchical compression encoder model CPGBERT to detect whether the target function has defects. By using the regularity of the program context and structure, the program code is sliced for the input-output variables related to the objective function and dependencies on the codes’ propagation paths. Extract multiple code property graph information on rich semantics from the sliced program code for graph fusion, and embed the fused code property graph into the model by grouping. During the learning process, the independent hidden layer features are compressed and aggregated to make the model focus on the deep semantic learning of the objective function. The experiment uses the CodeXGLUE benchmark dataset and compares 6 kinds of code defect detection models having better performance to perform defect detection and effect evaluation on actual engineering code.

The information is important to understand SVs and prioritize their fixing. Using large-scale data from 1,782 functions of 429 SVs in 200 real-world projects, we investigate ML models for automating function-level SV assessment tasks, i.e., predicting seven Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) metrics. We particularly study the value and use of vulnerable statements as inputs for developing the assessment models because SVs in functions are originated in these statements. We show that vulnerable statements are 5.8 times smaller in size, yet exhibit 7.5-114.5% stronger assessment performance (Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC)) than non-vulnerable statements. Incorporating context of vulnerable statements further increases the performance by up to 8.9% (0.64 MCC and 0.75 F1-Score).

Machine learning models can achieve impressive results in finding and forecasting possible security issues in programs. However, most of the current approaches fall short of developer demands in two areas at least: explainability and granularity of predictions. In this paper, we propose a novel and simple yet, promising approach to identify potentially vulnerable source code in JavaScript programs. The model improves the state-of-the-art in terms of explainability and prediction granularity as it gives results at the level of individual source code lines, which is fine-grained enough for developers to take immediate actions. Additionally, the model explains each predicted line (i.e., provides the most similar vulnerable line from the training set) using a prototype-based approach. In a study of 186 real-world and confirmed JavaScript vulnerability fixes of 91 projects, the approach could flag 60% of the known vulnerable lines on average by marking only 10% of the code-base, but in particular cases, the model identified 100% of the vulnerable code lines while flagging only 8.72% of the code-base.",,978-1-7281-8476-0,10.1109/ICCQ51190.2021.9392984,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9392984,software security;vulnerability prediction;data mining;CVE;explainable ML,Training;Prototypes;Machine learning;Predictive models;Tools;Software;Security,authoring languages;explanation;learning (artificial intelligence);program diagnostics;security of data;software prototyping;source code (software);system monitoring,software development;code analysis;security risks;dynamic analysis;machine learning;vulnerable source code;JavaScript programs;prediction granularity;static analysis;prediction explainability;prototype based explainable JavaScript vulnerability prediction,,3.0,,22.0,IEEE,8 Apr 2021,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,False,False,False,True

If unchecked, auto-generated code can trigger security issues and incorrect quality and productivity calculations. Besides, devising a generic algorithm is difficult because of the colossal size of repositories and diversified technology stack. That is why researchers are trying to detect, scrutinize, verify, and validate code in terms of security, copyrights, and code licenses to exclude auto-generated code during quality and productivity analysis. It will improve the software reliability and integrity, code quality, maintainability of deliverable, correct productivity calculation and ensure code’s adherence to copyrights and licenses.Auto-generated code detection detects machine-generated code, external libraries, minified files/packages/bundles files, and anomaly files [1]. Among these, the anomaly files have one-time large commits and code from other repositories. Such files force the quality analysis tools to slow down or hang or produce incorrect quality reports causing major bottlenecks. Also, the manual identification of auto-generated code is time-consuming and not sustainable. These acted as a catalyst for our extensive research to detect auto-generated code with high accuracy.

In this article, we present a vulnerability detector that can simultaneously achieve a high detection capability and a high locating precision, dubbed Vulnerability Deep learning-based Locator (VulDeeLocator). In the course of designing VulDeeLocator, we encounter difficulties including how to accommodate semantic relations between the definitions of types as well as macros and their uses across files, how to accommodate accurate control flows and variable define-use relations, and how to achieve high locating precision. We solve these difficulties by using two innovative ideas: (i) leveraging intermediate code to accommodate extra semantic information, and (ii) using the notion of granularity refinement to pin down locations of vulnerabilities. When applied to 200 files randomly selected from three real-world software products, VulDeeLocator detects 18 confirmed vulnerabilities (i.e., true-positives).

In backbone-net, we generate a CFG graph according to the variables and function calling relationships of the solidity code, and use the CFG graph to build the corresponding relationship of nodes and generate a non-Euclidean graph. Then we use the adjacent search algorithm to generate a non-complete random walk sequence, and use the graph embedding algorithm Node2Vec to generate a 256-dimensional vector and gain another weight matrix. We input the test code into GVD-net to generate the threshold ϑ in the final section and will classify the smart contract as danger code if the ϑ is bigger than 0.75.

By analyzing and comparing the performance of traceable patterns with metrics, we propose a vulnerability prediction model. This study explores the performance of some code patterns in vulnerability prediction and compares them with traditional software metrics. We use the findings to build an effective vulnerability prediction model. We evaluate security vulnerabilities reported for Apache Tomcat, Apache CXF and three stand-alone Java web applications.

Cryptographic key-based security mechanisms are heavyweight by demanding resources more than many resource-constraint IoT devices can provide, and are also vulnerable to side-channel invasive attacks. PUFs utilize integrated circuits' manufacturing variations to produce responses unique for individual devices, and hence cannot be reproduced. An important goal of security research is to discover all possible insecure risks, which can provide secure application developers useful information so that they can avoid the risk-containing components or mechanisms. While physically unclonable, some PUFs have been found to be mathematically clonable by machine learning methods. Large XOR arbiter PUFs is one group of PUFs that were shown to withstand existing attack methods unless long training time is used in the machine learning process. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of a neural network method in attacking large XOR PUFs, a neural network method modified to handle training datasets possibly larger than memory capacity. Our study shows that the modified neural network method attains high prediction accuracy while consuming substantially less time for large XOR PUFs than the fastest machine learning code used in all earlier studies known to us. Some of the large XOR PUFs that took existing machine learning codes several days of parallel computing time on high-performance computing servers have been broken by our method in less than two hours, indicating vulnerability of even large XOR PUFs. Discovery of all potential vulnerabilities of a PUF is important since secure application developers need such information for deciding which PUF to choose, and an unidentified vulnerability can lead to security risks for IoT devices.",,978-1-5386-7244-0,10.1109/ICIOT.2018.00014,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8473439,"Physical Unclonable Functions, Hardware Security, Machine Learning, Internet of Things",Machine learning;Delays;Cryptography;Neural networks;Internet of Things;Manufacturing,cryptography;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets,machine learning-based security vulnerability study;key-based security mechanisms;resource-constraint IoT devices;security research;secure application developers useful information;machine learning methods;machine learning process;fastest machine learning code;machine learning codes several days;security risks;XOR arbiter PUF;resource-constraint Internet of Things;modified neural network method,,43.0,,16.0,IEEE,27 Sep 2018,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,False,True,True,

This paper presents SEVulDet, a Semantics-Enhanced learnable Vulnerability Detector that can accurately pinpoint vulnerability patterns by preserving path semantics into gadgets and learning from flexible-length codes. SEVulDet has two main characteristics: (i) SEVulDet employs a path-sensitive code slicing approach to extract sufficient path semantics and control flow logic into code gadgets. (ii) by inserting a spatial pyramidal pooling layer into the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a well-designed multilayer attention mechanism, SEVulDet can handle gadgets of flexible-length semantics to avoid semantics loss incurred by traditional truncating or padding operations, and thus learn more potential vulnerability patterns. Comprehensive experimental results show that SEVulDet significantly outperforms classical static approaches and excels with state-of-the-art deep learning-based solutions by improving F1-measure to roughly 94.5%.

Static Analysis Tools (SATs) are widely used for vulnerability detection, where the source code is analyzed without executing it. However, the performance of SATs varies considerably and a high detection rate usually comes with significant false alarms. Recent studies considered combining various SATs to improve the overall detection ability, but they do not allow exploring different performance trade-offs, as basic and rigid rules are normally followed. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms have shown promising results in several complex problems, due to their ability to fit specific needs. This paper presents an exploratory study on the combination of the output of SATs through ML algorithms to improve vulnerability detection while trying to reduce false alarms. The dataset consists of SQL Injection (SQLi) and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities detected by five different SATs in a large set of WordPress plugins developed in PHP. Results show that, for the case of SQLi, a false alarm reduction is possible without compromising the vulnerabilities detected, and that using ML allows trade-offs (e.g., reduction in false alarms at the expense of a few vulnerabilities) that are not possible with existing techniques. The paper also proposes a regression-based approach for ranking source code files considering estimates of vulnerabilities computed using the output of SATs.

However, as technology integrates itself, the risk of security vulnerabilities and their impact also grows. Different languages have different susceptibilities to cyberattacks. Programs based on C and C++ are particularly vulnerable to cyberattacks through buffer overflow errors due to their lack of memory management. While security vulnerabilities are well-studied areas, with the increasing popularity of deep learning applications, the attack scenarios have become more sophis-ticated, and traditional techniques may no longer be enough to detect attacks or potential vulnerabilities. Therefore, the application of using deep learning to detect such vulnerabilities has become a trend. The appeal of using deep learning in software security is usually based on graphical models and data, which encourages researchers to use graphical-based deep learning methods like Graph Neural Networks (GNN). In this study, we use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect security vulnerabilities due to its scalability and lower computation need. This paper proposes scanning vulnerable C/C++ functions for vulnerabilities using deep learning-based image classification. Our experiments are performed on the NIST SARD dataset. Inspired by existing high-level language vulnerability detection, we propose converting the function into an image through three steps: sentence embedding, a statically created program dependency graph, and social network analysis.We employ sentence embedding to convert each line of code into an equally sized representative vector. Following this, we produce a program dependency graph (PDG) for each function. Each line of code is then analyzed using three metrics: Katz, closeness, and destructibility. We compute the destructibility metric by employing forward-slicing on the PDG to determine the reachability of each line. The combination of the equally sized vectors and the analysis metrics are used to create a representative image of the source code.

Existing machine learning and deep learning methods addressing vulnerabilities in smart contracts often partially combine pooled features from first the contract source code, second, the build based approach made of features extracted during source code compilation, and third, the bytecode approach relying on features obtained from the Ethereum virtual machine bytecode analysis. Together those three approaches form the full-stack, and they are usually being conducted under static analysis thanks to its speed of execution. However, to the best of our knowledge, no single work has yet simultaneously undertaken a full-stack intralayer and cross-layer features fusion for smart contracts vulnerability assessment under static analysis, without making use of expert-based patterns nor without manually fusing the various features extracted from shuffled partial combinations of layers in the full-stack. This paper introduces a full-stack hierarchical fusion of static features for smart contracts vulnerability detection. In our construction, we associate each layer of the full-stack to a modality and leverage automatic intramodality and crossmodality pooled features fusion from state-of-the-art artificial neural networks and deep neural networks. Additionally, our models are applied to the hierarchy of power set layers in the full-stack, without any expert-based rule.

Secondly, graph embedding of code slices is constructed by clustering neighborhood information. Finally, GGNN is used to learn the syntax and semantic information of vulnerability codes for graph-level classification. Furthermore, we theoretically analyze that GGNN has a strong inductive learning ability. This means that the model requires only a small amount of training data to obtain sufficient advanced features, which is significant for vulnerability detection tasks that are difficult to collect data sets.

We apply machine learning to uncover a system implementation structure that includes its normal functions from the design, as well as the hidden malicious behaviors.

To achieve scalable vulnerability scanning, some prior studies intend to process the source code directly by treating them as text. To achieve accurate vulnerability detection, other approaches consider distilling the program semantics into graph representations and using them to detect vulnerability. In practice, text-based techniques are scalable but not accurate due to the lack of program semantics. Graph-based methods are accurate but not scalable since graph analysis is typically time-consuming. In this paper, we aim to achieve both scalability and accuracy on scanning large-scale source code vulnerabilities.

Specifically, we propose a novel idea that can efficiently convert the source code of a function into an image while preserving the program details. We implement Vul-CNN and evaluate it on a dataset of 13,687 vulnerable functions and 26,970 non-vulnerable functions. Experimental results report that VulCNN can achieve better accuracy than eight state-of-the-art vul-nerability detectors (i.e., Checkmarx, FlawFinder, RATS, TokenCNN, VulDeePecker, SySeVR, VulDeeLocator, and Devign). As for scalability, VulCNN is about four times faster than VulDeePecker and SySeVR, about 15 times faster than VulDeeLocator, and about six times faster than Devign. Furthermore, we conduct a case study on more than 25 million lines of code and the result indicates that VulCNN can detect large-scale vulnerability. Through the scanning reports, we finally discover 73 vulnerabilities that are not reported in NVD.",1558-1225,978-1-4503-9221-1,10.1145/3510003.3510229,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9793871,Vulnerability Detection;CNN;Large Scale;Image,Deep learning;Codes;Scalability;Semantics;Detectors;Transforms;Rats,graph theory;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);program diagnostics;public domain software;security of data;software performance evaluation;software tools;text analysis,large-scale vulnerability;VulCNN;image-inspired scalable vulnerability detection system;deep learning;source code vulnerability;scalable vulnerability scanning;accurate vulnerability detection;program semantics;graph representations;text-based techniques;graph-based methods;graph analysis;large-scale source code vulnerabilities;existing DL-based image classification;program details;Vul-CNN;times faster,,4.0,,57.0,,20 Jun 2022,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,False,False,False,True

Furthermore, data scientists are increasingly using programming languages such as Python, R etc. to process data using many existing libraries. In some cases, the developed code will be automatically executed by the NoSQL system on the stored data.

It is important to develop an automatic vulnerability analysis system to improve the countermeasures. However, source code is not always available (e.g., most IoT related industry software are closed source). Therefore, vulnerability detection on binary code is a demanding task. This article addresses the automatic binary-level software vulnerability detection problem by proposing a deep learning-based approach. The proposed approach consists of two phases: binary function extraction, and model building. First, we extract binary functions from the cleaned binary instructions obtained by using IDA Pro. Then, we employ the attention mechanism on top of a bidirectional long short-term memory for building the predictive model. To show the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we have collected datasets from several different sources. We have compared our proposed approach with a series of baselines including source code-based techniques and binary code-based techniques.

Recently, the deep learning methods using convolutional neural network(CNN) have actively studied to classify images transformed from smart contracts into vulnerable or invulnerable.

To address Hardly Reproducible Vulnerabilities (HRVs), security experts spend a significant amount of time, effort, and budget. Sometimes they do not succeed in the reproduction step and ignore some security failures. The exploitation of a vulnerability due to its irreproducibility may cause severe consequences. An efficient solution is to explore the behaviour of both hardly and easily reproducible security issues at the code level. We use linear regression techniques to build models based on the classical software complexity metrics and a set of attributes related to the environment of the system. The results show that the considered metrics and the vulnerability types do not have significant linear correlations with each other. Also, predicting the HRV-prone parts of large systems is a great help for security experts to focus their effort on the top-ranked vulnerable files. After identifying the suitable indicators based on linear regression, different machine learning techniques such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, C4.5 Decision Tree, and Naive Bayes are employed to build HRV prediction models.

It has been widely used in different code analysis applications and security-related tasks such as detecting ghostwriting, resolving copyright disputes, etc. For several decades it has become an emerging research topic in the field of plagiarism detection. Most of the identification methods consider code samples of a single author. However, the development of real-world software needs a team effort. As a result, multiple authors identification of source code is still a great research challenge. To overcome the challenge, we propose a Deep Learning approach to identify multiple authors of source codes by analyzing the coding style of authors. In this method, we use several machine learning and deep learning-based algorithm i.e. Deep Neural Network(DNN), Support Vector Machine(SVM), and Long short-term memory(LSTM) for detecting multiple authors from source code. The code2seq model over Abstract Syntax Tree is used to identify the structural representation of source code which helps to achieve better performance of the algorithms. The evaluation result of our model shows that it gains remarkable accuracy in identifying multiple contributors of source codes. The deep neural network model outperforms the other algorithms by achieving 96.7 % classification accuracy.",,978-1-6654-2363-2,10.1109/ICECIT54077.2021.9641497,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9641497,Authorship Identification;Multiple Author Identification;Deep Learning;Support Vector Machine;LSTM;cod2seq Model;AST,Deep learning;Codes;Machine learning algorithms;Plagiarism;Support vector machine classification;Syntactics;Software,learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;support vector machines;text analysis,multiple authors identification;source code;different security-related applications;different code analysis applications;code2seq model,,1.0,,16.0,IEEE,21 Dec 2021,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,False,True,True,

Software engineers often inject vulnerabilities into their programs to test the reliability of their test suites, vulnerability detectors, and security measures. However, state-of-the-art vulnerability injection methods only capture code syntax/patterns, they do not learn the intent of the vulnerability and are limited to the syntax of the original dataset. To address this challenge, we propose the first intent-based vulnerability injection method that learns both the program syntax and vulnerability intent. Our approach applies a combination of NLP methods and semantic-preserving program mutations (at the bytecode level) to inject code vulnerabilities. Given a dataset of known vulnerabilities (containing benign and vulnerable code pairs), our approach proceeds by employing semantic-preserving program mutations to transform the existing dataset to semantically similar code. Then, it learns the intent of the vulnerability via neural machine translation (Seq2Seq) models. The key insight is to employ Seq2Seq to learn the intent (context) of the vulnerable code in a manner that is agnostic of the specific program instance. We evaluate the performance of our approach using 1275 vulnerabilities belonging to five (5) CWEs from the Juliet test suite. We examine the effectiveness of our approach in producing compilable and vulnerable code. Our results show that IntJECT is effective, almost all (99%) of the code produced by our approach is vulnerable and compilable. We also demonstrate that the vulnerable programs generated by IntJECT are semantically similar to the withheld original vulnerable code.

Therefore, armored attackers may misuse this information to launch N-day attacks on unpatched OSS versions. The best practice for preventing this type of N-day attacks is to keep upgrading the software to the latest version in no time. However, due to the concerns on reputation and easy software development management, software vendors may choose to secretly patch their vulnerabilities in a new version without reporting them to CVE or even providing any explicit description in their change logs. When those secretly patched vulnerabilities are being identified by armored attackers, they can be turned into powerful ""0-day"" attacks, which can be exploited to compromise not only unpatched version of the same software, but also similar types of OSS (e.g., SSL libraries) that may contain the same vulnerability due to code clone or similar design/implementation logic. Therefore, it is critical to identify secret security patches and downgrade the risk of those ""0-day"" attacks to at least ""n-day"" attacks. In this paper, we develop a defense system and implement a toolset to automatically identify secret security patches in open source software. To distinguish security patches from other patches, we first build a security patch database that contains more than 4700 security patches mapping to the records in CVE list. Next, we identify a set of features to help distinguish security patches from non-security ones using machine learning approaches. Finally, we use code clone identification mechanisms to discover similar patches or vulnerabilities in similar types of OSS.

In order to improve the detection performance, multiple vulnerability-relevant data sources were selected to form a broader base for learning transferable knowledge. The selected vulnerability-relevant data sources are cross-domain, including historical vulnerability data from different software projects and data from the Software Assurance Reference Database (SARD) consisting of synthetic vulnerability examples and proof-of-concept test cases. To extract the information applicable in vulnerability detection from the cross-domain data sets, we designed a deep-learning-based framework with Long-short Term Memory (LSTM) cells. Our framework combines the heterogeneous data sources to learn unified representations of the patterns of the vulnerable source codes. Empirical studies showed that the unified representations generated by the proposed deep learning networks are feasible and effective, and are transferable for real-world vulnerability detection.

Metric-based and pattern-based methods have been presented for identifying vulnerable code. The former relies on machine learning and cannot work well due to the severe imbalance between non-vulnerable and vulnerable code or lack of features to characterize vulnerabilities. The latter needs the prior knowledge of known vulnerabilities and can only identify similar but not new types of vulnerabilities. In this paper, we propose and implement a generic, lightweight and extensible framework, LEOPARD, to identify potentially vulnerable functions through program metrics. LEOPARD requires no prior knowledge about known vulnerabilities. It has two steps by combining two sets of systematically derived metrics. First, it uses complexity metrics to group the functions in a target application into a set of bins. Then, it uses vulnerability metrics to rank the functions in each bin and identifies the top ones as potentially vulnerable. Our experimental results on 11 real-world projects have demonstrated that, LEOPARD can cover 74.0% of vulnerable functions by identifying 20% of functions as vulnerable and outperform machine learning-based and static analysis-based techniques.

There is an increasing need to detect similar code for vulnerability search across architectures with the increase of critical vulnerabilities in IoT devices. The variety of IoT hardware architectures and software platforms requires to capture semantic equivalence of code fragments in the similarity detection. However, existing approaches are insufficient in capturing the semantic similarity. We notice that the abstract syntax tree (AST) of a function contains rich semantic information. Inspired by successful applications of natural language processing technologies in sentence semantic understanding, we propose a deep learning-based AST-encoding method, named ASTERIA, to measure the semantic equivalence of functions in different platforms. Our method leverages the Tree-LSTM network to learn the semantic representation of a function from its AST. Then the similarity detection can be conducted efficiently and accurately by measuring the similarity between two representation vectors. We have implemented an open-source prototype of ASTERIA.

With the development of machine learning and neural network algorithm, automatically identify information from verification code become convenient for machines. Meanwhile, multimedia security has become an important field of research about watermarking, which is a technique that embeds some identity information into audio or image, and then the embedded information can be restored for different purposes.

These vulnerabilities should ideally be found and fixed before the code gets deployed. Machine learning-based approaches achieve state-of-the-art performance in capturing vulnerabilities. These methods are predominantly supervised. Their prediction models are trained on a set of ground truth data where the training data and test data are assumed to be drawn from the same probability distribution. However, in practice, the test data often differs from the training data in terms of distribution because they are from different projects or they differ in the types of vulnerability.

We employ DL because it has the capacity of automatically constructing high-level abstract feature representations of programs, which are likely of more cross-domain useful than the handcrafted features driven by domain knowledge. The divergence between distributions is reduced by learning cross-domain representations. First, given software program representations, CD-VulD converts them into token sequences and learns the token embeddings for generalization across tokens. Next, CD-VulD employs a deep feature model to build abstract high-level presentations based on those sequences. Then, the metric transfer learning framework (MTLF) technique is employed to learn cross-domain representations by minimizing the distribution divergence between the source domain and the target domain. Finally, the cross-domain representations are used to build a classifier for vulnerability detection. Experimental results show that CD-VulD outperforms the state-of-the-art vulnerability detection approaches by a wide margin.

However, many identified bugs and vulnerabilities in smart contracts have led to serious financial losses, which raises serious concerns about smart contract security. Thus, there is a significant need to better maintain smart contract code and ensure its high reliability. In this research: (1) Firstly, we propose an automated deep learning based approach to learn structural code embeddings of smart contracts in Solidity, which is useful for clone detection, bug detection and contract validation on smart contracts. We apply our approach to more than 22K solidity contracts collected from the Ethereum blockchain, results show that the clone ratio of solidity code is at around 90%, much higher than traditional software. We collect a list of 52 known buggy smart contracts belonging to 10 kinds of common vulnerabilities as our bug database. Our approach can identify more than 1000 clone related bugs based on our bug databases efficiently and accurately. (2) Secondly, according to developers' feedback, we have implemented the approach in a web-based tool, named Smartembed, to facilitate Solidity developers for using our approach. Our tool can assist Solidity developers to efficiently identify repetitive smart contracts in the existing Ethereum blockchain, as well as checking their contract against a known set of bugs. which can help to improve the users' confidence in the reliability of the contract. We optimize the implementations of Smartembed which is sufficient in supporting developers in real-time for practical uses.

As a decentralized system architecture, smart contracts give the blockchain a user-defined logical concept. The smart contract is an executable program that can be used for automatic transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. In 2016, the DAO attack resulted in the theft of 60M USD due to unsafe smart contracts. Smart contracts are vulnerable to hacking because they are difficult to patch and there is a lack of assessment standards for ensuring their quality. Hackers can exploit the vulnerabilities in smart contracts when they have been published on Ethereum. Thus, this study presents SoliAudit (Solidity Audit), which uses machine learning and fuzz testing for smart contract vulnerability assessment. SoliAudit employs machine learning technology using Solidity machine code as learning features to verify 13 kinds of vulnerabilities, which have been listed as Top 10 threats by an open security organization. We also created a gray-box fuzz testing mechanism, which consists of a fuzzer contract and a simulated blockchain environment for on-line transaction verification.

To mitigate buffer overflows, developers typically perform size checks and input validation. We propose static code attributes characterizing buffer usage and defense mechanisms implemented in the code for preventing buffer overflows. The proposed approach starts by identifying potential vulnerable statement constructs during binary program analysis and extracts static code attributes for each of them as per proposed characterization scheme to capture buffer usage patterns and defensive mechanisms employed in the code.

Existing attack methods perturb a source program by renaming one or multiple variables in the program. These attack methods do not take into account the perturbation of the equivalent structural transformations of the source code. We propose a set of program transformations involving identifier renaming and structural transformations, which can ensure that the perturbed program retains the original semantics but can fool the source code processing model to change the original prediction result. We propose a novel method of applying semantics-preserving structural transformations to attack the source program pro-cessing model in the white-box setting. This is the first time that semantics-preserving structural transformations are applied to generate adversarial examples of source code processing models.

GraphEye is originated from the observation that the code property graph of a non-vulnerable function naturally differs from the code property graph of a vulnerable function with the same functionality. Hence, detecting vulnerable functions is attributed to the graph classification problem. GraphEye is comprised of VecCPG and GcGAT. VecCPG is a vectorization for the code property graph, which is proposed to characterize the key syntax and semantic features of the corresponding source code. GcGAT is a deep learning model based on the graph attention networks, which is proposed to solve the graph classification problem according to VecCPG.

Therefore, testing the software from a vulnerability discovery perspective becomes challenging for developers if they do not inspect their code thoroughly (which is time-consuming). We propose that vulnerability prediction using certain software metrics can support the testing process by identifying vulnerable code-components (e.g., functions, classes, etc.). Once a code-component is predicted as vulnerable, the developers can focus their testing efforts on it, thereby avoiding the time/effort required for testing the entire application. The current paper presents a study that compares how software metrics perform as vulnerability predictors for software projects developed in two different languages (Java vs Python). The goal of this research is to analyze the vulnerability prediction performance of software metrics for different programming languages. We designed and conducted experiments on security vulnerabilities reported for three Java projects (Apache Tomcat 6, Tomcat 7, Apache CXF) and two Python projects (Django and Keystone). In this paper, we focus on a specific type of code component: Functions. We apply Machine Learning models for predicting vulnerable functions. Overall results show that software metrics-based vulnerability prediction is more useful for Java projects than Python projects (i.e., software metrics when used as features were able to predict Java vulnerable functions with a higher recall and precision compared to Python vulnerable functions prediction).",,978-1-7281-1664-8,10.1109/CSE/EUC.2019.00028,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8919513,"software security, software metrics, vulnerability prediction, software reliability, machine learning",Software metrics;Java;Python;Security;Testing,Java;learning (artificial intelligence);public domain software;safety-critical software;security of data;software metrics,Python open source projects;code-component;vulnerability predictors;software projects;vulnerability prediction performance;security vulnerabilities;Java projects;code component;software metrics-based vulnerability prediction;Java vulnerable functions;Python vulnerable function prediction,,1.0,,25.0,IEEE,5 Dec 2019,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,False,False,False,

In practice, the timely application of security patches in downstream software is challenging. The main reason is that such patches do not explicitly indicate their security impacts in the documentation, which would be difficult to recognize for software maintainers and users. However, attackers can still identify these “secret” security patches by analyzing the source code and generate corresponding exploits to compromise not only unpatched versions of the current software, but also other similar software packages that may contain the same vulnerability due to code cloning or similar design/implementation logic. Therefore, it is critical to identify these secret security patches to enable timely fixes. To this end, we propose a deep learning-based defense system called PatchRNN to automatically identify secret security patches in OSS.

Malicious code is one of the main threats to network security. Different types of malicious code have different functions and cause different harms. Therefore, improving the detection efficiency and recognition accuracy of malicious code is becoming an urgent problem to be solved. While traditional machine learning methods for malicious code detection largely depend on hand-designed features with experts' knowledge of the domain or focus on the images which come from malicious code binary files. These methods spend too much time on feature extraction. With the emergence of a large amount of malicious code data, the efficiency of traditional machine learning algorithms is getting worse and worse. In this paper, a workflow based on deep learning is proposed to detect and classify malicious codes. This workflow adopts a convolutional neural network (CNN) and the regularization algorithms to classify malicious code with N_gram semantic feature as input of the model. The convolutional neural network can automatically extract the features of malicious code while avoiding the need for manual feature selection. Regularization algorithms not only speed up the training process of the deep model but also improve the generalization ability in the case of effective prevention of over-fitting of the model. The proposed method is compared with the state-of-the-art methods and other deep learning models.

Firstly, the original gray image is transformed into more distinctive sample data by image segmentation technology, which makes the data set increase the distance between classes and reduce the distance within classes, and then the feature extraction and training are carried out through the deep residual network. In the paper, Malimg data set is used to test.

This becomes even more important in today's software ecosystem, where vulnerable code can flow easily and unwittingly within and across software repositories like GitHub. Across such millions of lines of code, traditional static and dynamic approaches struggle to scale. Although existing machine-learning-based approaches look promising in such a setting, most work detects vulnerable code at a higher granularity – at the method or file level. Thus, developers still need to inspect a significant amount of code to locate the vulnerable statement(s) that need to be fixed. This paper presents Velvet, a novel ensemble learning approach to locate vulnerable statements. Our model combines graph-based and sequence-based neural networks to successfully capture the local and global context of a program graph and effectively understand code semantics and vulnerable patterns. To study Velvet's effectiveness, we use an off-the-shelf synthetic dataset and a recently published real-world dataset. In the static analysis setting, where vulnerable functions are not detected in advance, Velvet achieves 4.5× better performance than the baseline static analyzers on the real-world data. For the isolated vulnerability localization task, where we assume the vulnerability of a function is known while the specific vulnerable statement is unknown, we compare Velvet with several neural networks that also attend to local and global context of code.

For example, Static Analysis Tools (SATs) report potential vulnerabilities by analyzing code patterns, and Software Metrics (SMs) can be used to predict vulnerabilities based on high-level characteristics of the code. In theory, both approaches can be applied from the early stages of the development process, but it is well known that they fail to detect critical vulnerabilities and raise a large number of false alarms. This paper studies the hypothesis of using Machine Learning (ML) to combine alerts from SATs with SMs to predict vulnerabilities in a large software project (under development for many years). In practice, we use four ML algorithms, alerts from two SATs, and a large number of SMs to predict whether a source code file is vulnerable or not (binary classification) and to predict the vulnerability category (multiclass classification). Results show that one can achieve either high precision or high recall, but not both at the same time.

To this end, we use several machine learning algorithms (Random Forest, Extreme Boosting, Decision Tree, SVM Linear, and SVM Radial) to extract vulnerability-related knowledge from software metrics collected from the source code of several representative software projects developed in C/C++ (Mozilla Firefox, Linux Kernel, Apache HTTPd, Xen, and Glibc).

The top-level ensemble model aggregates the behavior classification of all the trace segments and detects an attack.

However, these rules and vulnerability features are difficult to be defined and designed accurately, which makes static analysis face many challenges in practical applications.

A variety of methods have been proposed to detect vulnerabilities in real-world software. Recent methods based on deep learning approaches for automatic feature extraction have improved software vulnerability identification compared with machine learning approaches based on hand-crafted feature extraction. However, these methods can usually only detect software vulnerabilities at a function or program level, which is much less informative because, out of hundreds (thousands) of code statements in a program or function, only a few core statements contribute to a software vulnerability. This requires us to find a way to detect software vulnerabilities at a fine-grained level. In this paper, we propose a novel method based on the concept of mutual information that can help us to detect and isolate software vulnerabilities at a fine-grained level (i.e., several statements that are highly relevant to a software vulnerability that include the core vulnerable statements) in both unsupervised and semi-supervised contexts.

The severe nature of this bug has occasioned the building of blocking bug prediction (BBP) models for early detection of BBs during software maintenance. Traditional approaches to building these models usually rely on software metrics (i.e., Lack of cohesion, coupling between objects, cyclomatic complexity, and LOC) mined from source code files, and the use of machine learning techniques. However, empirical evidence suggests that these metrics often fail to capture the syntax and semantic information between programs. This significantly affects the performance of the prediction models built on these features. To address these issues, this paper introduces a framework that leverages a deep learning model, DeepLaBB, to automatically learn semantic features using token vectors, and then applies the features to build and train a model that predicts whether a bug is considered blocking or non-blocking. To show the effectiveness of the proposed approach, eight large-scale open-source projects, namely Chromium, Eclipse, NetBeans, OpenOffice, Gentoo, Fedora, Mozilla, and NetBeans containing over 609,800 bugs were used for the training and validation needs of the models. The proposed ensemble deep learning model (DeepLaBB) was benchmarked against four traditional machine learning techniques, namely Random Forest, Artificial Neural Network, Classification, and regression Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbour. Performance evaluation measures, namely F1-score, MCC, and AUC were used to measure the performance of the models. On average, DeepLaBB achieved an MCC of 0.8504%, F1 Score of 0.4292%, and AUC of 2.9459%. The results show that DeepLaBB achieves a better BB prediction performance than the baseline conventional machine learning models proposed in previous studies.

Although there is research that focuses on vulnerability prediction and discovery, there is still a need for building security-specific metrics to measure software security and vulnerability-proneness quantitatively. The existing methods are either based on software metrics (defined on the physical characteristics of code; e.g. complexity or lines of code) which are not security-specific or some generic patterns known as nano-patterns (Java method-level traceable patterns that characterize a Java method or function). Other methods predict vulnerabilities using text mining approaches or graph algorithms which perform poorly in cross-project validation and fail to be a generalized prediction model for any system. In this paper, we envision to construct an automated framework that will assist developers to assess the security level of their code and guide them towards developing secure code. To accomplish this goal, we aim to refine and redefine the existing nano-patterns and software metrics to make them more security-centric so that they can be used for measuring the software security level of a source code (either file or function) with higher accuracy. In this paper, we present our visionary approach through a series of three consecutive studies where we (1) will study the challenges of the current software metrics and nano-patterns in vulnerability prediction, (2) will redefine and characterize the nano-patterns and software metrics so that they can capture security-specific properties of code and measure the security level quantitatively, and finally (3) will implement an automated framework for the developers to automatically extract the values of all the patterns and metrics for the given code segment and then flag the estimated security level as a feedback based on our research results.

Yet, it is crucial for OSS users to be aware of vulnerability fixes as early as possible, as once a vulnerability fix is pushed to the source code repository, a malicious party could probe for the corresponding vulnerability to exploit it. In practice, OSS users often rely on the vulnerability disclosure information from security advisories (e.g., National Vulnerability Database) to sense vulnerability fixes. However, the time between the availability of a vulnerability fix and its disclosure can vary from days to months, and in some cases, even years. Due to manpower constraints and the lack of expert knowledge, it is infeasible for OSS users to manually analyze all code changes for vulnerability fix detection. Therefore, it is essential to identify vulnerability fixes automatically and promptly. In a first-of-its-kind study, we propose VulFixMiner, a Transformer-based approach, capable of automatically extracting semantic meaning from commit-level code changes to identify silent vulnerability fixes. We construct our model using sampled commits from 204 projects, and evaluate using the full set of commits from 52 additional projects. The evaluation results show that VulFixMiner outperforms various state-of-the-art baselines in terms of AUC (i.e., 0.81 and 0.73 on Java and Python dataset, respectively) and two effort-aware performance metrics (i.e., EffortCost, Popt). Especially, with an effort of inspecting 5% of total LOC, VulFixMiner can identify 49% of total vulnerability fixes. Additionally, with manual verification of sampled commits that were identified as vulnerability fixes, but not marked as such in our dataset, we observe that 35% (29 out of 82) of the commits are for fixing vulnerabilities, indicating VulFixMiner is also capable of identifying unreported vulnerability fixes.",2643-1572,978-1-6654-0337-5,10.1109/ASE51524.2021.9678720,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9678720,Software Security;Vulnerability Fix;Open Source Software;Deep Learning,Measurement;Codes;Semantics;Transformers;Needles;Security;Probes,data mining;Java;public domain software;security of data,coordinated vulnerability disclosure model;OSS;vulnerability disclosure information;national vulnerability database;vulnerability fix detection;automated mining;open source software;security advisories;VulFixMiner,,16.0,,53.0,IEEE,20 Jan 2022,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,False,False,False,True

However, they cannot provide fundamental solutions for a security intrusion or attacks, which are becoming more intelligent and diverse as time passes. Therefore, an effective response method that can respond to security intrusions intelligently while using an access control technique based on ontology reasoning is required. This can be achieved by adopting a variety of intelligent reasoning technologies for security intrusion incidents of power systems, such as various reasoning technologies based on the ontology and semantic-web technologies being actively studied in the field of intelligent systems, and malicious code detection technologies based on an intelligent access control model, text mining, and natural language processing technologies. Accordingly, a security context ontology was modeled by analyzing the security vulnerabilities of a power system in a power IoT-Cloud environment, and security context inference rules were defined. Furthermore, this paper presents an appropriate power IoT-Cloud security service framework that can be used in a power IoT-Cloud environment. In addition, a security mechanism that can be efficiently operated in such an environment is implemented. In experiments conducted for this application, attack context scenarios that commonly occur were created using a smart meter as an example, which is an essential power system device. Inference rules were then composed for each attack stage to check the paths of attacks those that exploit the vulnerability of a smart meter system.

Nevertheless, we are still facing from ransomware threats, as it is difficult to detect and prevent ransomware containing unknown malicious codes. In particular, these methods are limited in that they cannot detect ransomware for backup systems such as cloud services.

However, software vulnerabilities are diverse, and mining vulnerabilities through source code requires a high level of professional experience for developers.

In recent years, with the booming development of artificial intelligence technology, some scholars have started to try to combine graph neural networks to extract graph structure information of source code for software vulnerability detection. In this paper, by introducing a method based on Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN) combined with a self-attention aggregation mechanism for vulnerability detection, we achieve superior detection results.

This makes it more difficult to filter or detect malware applications. In serious cases, it will greatly affect the efficiency of mobile communication and threaten the security of distributed computers.

Unfortunately, most of existing grammar-based fuzzers require a lot of manual efforts of writing complex input grammars, which hinders their practical use. To address this problem, recently proposed approaches use machine learning to automatically acquire a generative model for structured inputs conforming to a complex grammar. Even such approaches, however, have major limitations: they fail to learn a generative model for instruction sequences, and they cannot achieve good coverage of instruction-parsing code. To overcome such limitations. this paper proposes a collection of techniques for enhancing learning-assisited grammar-based fuzzing. Our approach allows for the learning of a generative model for instruction sequences by training a hybrid character/token-level recursive neural network. In addition, we exploit coverage metrics gathered during previous runs of fuzzing in order to efficiently refine (or fine-tune) the learnt model so that it can make high coverage-inducing new inputs.

However, this is especially important for images from unknown cameras with unseen types of image degradation. In this work, we propose to jointly perform denoising and super-resolution.

Our experiments show that both variants have specific advantages: The in-network design obtains the strongest results when the type of image corruption is aligned in the training and testing dataset, for any choice of denoiser. The pre-network design exhibits superior performance on unseen types of image corruption, which is a pathological failure case of existing super-resolution models.

Early detection of vulnerable code during development is essential for the developers to make cost and time effective software testing. The traditional software metrics are used for early detection of software vulnerability, but they are not directly related to code constructs and do not specify any particular granularity level. The goal of this study is to help developers evaluate software security using class-level traceable patterns called micro patterns to reduce security risks. The concept of micro patterns is similar to design patterns, but they can be automatically recognized and mined from source code. If micro patterns can better predict vulnerable classes compared to traditional software metrics, they can be used in developing a vulnerability prediction model. This study explores the performance of class-level patterns in vulnerability prediction and compares them with traditional class-level software metrics. We studied security vulnerabilities as reported for one major release of Apache Tomcat, Apache Camel and three stand-alone Java web applications.

However, code often contains bugs—and so, given the vast quantity of unvetted code that Copilot has processed, it is certain that the language model will have learned from exploitable, buggy code. This raises concerns on the security of Copilot’s code contributions. In this work, we systematically investigate the prevalence and conditions that can cause GitHub Copilot to recommend insecure code. To perform this analysis we prompt Copilot to generate code in scenarios relevant to high-risk cybersecurity weaknesses, e.g. those from MITRE’s “Top 25” Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) list. We explore Copilot’s performance on three distinct code generation axes—examining how it performs given diversity of weaknesses, diversity of prompts, and diversity of domains.

A typical example is Android Things that Google supports. Compatibility based on the same platform can provide more convenient personalization services centering on mobile devices, while this uniformity-based computing environment can expose many security vulnerabilities. For example, new mobile malware running on Android can instantly transition to all connected devices. In particular, the Android platform has a structural weakness that makes it easy to repackage applications. This can lead to malicious behavior. To protect mobile apps that are vulnerable to malicious activity, various code obfuscation techniques are applied to key logic. The most effective one of this kind involves safely concealing application programming interfaces (API). It is very important to ensure that obfuscation is applied to the appropriate API with an adequate degree of resistance to reverse engineering. Because there is no objective evaluation method, it depends on the developer judgment. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a scheme that can quantitatively evaluate the level of hiding of APIs, which represent the function of the Android application based on machine learning theory. To perform the quantitative evaluation, the API information is obtained by static analysis of a DEX file, and the API-called code executed in Dalvik in the Android platform is dynamically extracted. Moreover, the sensitive APIs are classified using the extracted API and Naive Bayes classification. The proposed scheme yields a high score according to the level of hiding of the classified API. We tested the proposed scheme on representative applications of the Google Play Store. We believe it can be used as a model for obfuscation assessment schemes, because it can evaluate the level of obfuscation in general without relying on specific obfuscation tools.",2169-3536,,10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2693388,"Global Research Laboratory Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea; Ministry of Science, ICT, and Future Planning(grant numbers:NRF-2014K1A1A2043029);",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7898406,Android Things;mobile security;security assessment,Smart phones;Androids;Humanoid robots;Reverse engineering;Security;Malware;Static analysis,Android (operating system);application program interfaces;Bayes methods;Internet of Things;invasive software;learning (artificial intelligence);reverse engineering;smart phones;telecommunication security,obfuscation assessment scheme;Google Play Store;classified API;Naive Bayes classification;Dalvik;static analysis;API information;machine learning theory;Android application;objective evaluation method;reverse engineering;application programming interfaces;mobile apps;Android platform;mobile malware;security vulnerability;uniformity-based computing environment;mobile devices;Android-based Internet-of-Things devices;dynamic monitoring;code obfuscation security assessment,,20.0,,25.0,OAPA,12 Apr 2017,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals,False,True,True,

Therefore, many static analysis tools are often used to analyze code. Further, some of the alerts generated by the static analysis tools are low-priority or false alarms. Machine learning algorithms have been developed to distinguish between true alerts and false alarms, however significant man hours need to be dedicated to labeling data sets for training.

The approaches based on source code analysis cannot be applied to binary clone detection because the same source code can produce significantly different binaries due to different operating systems, microprocessor architectures and compilers. In this paper, we present BinSeeker, a cross-platform binary seeker that integrates semantic learning and emulation. With the help of the labeled semantic flow graph, BinSeeker can quickly identify $M$M candidate functions that are most similar to the vulnerability from the target binary. The value of $M$M is relatively large so this semantic learning procedure essentially eliminates those functions that are very unlikely to have the vulnerability. Then, semantic emulation is conducted on these $M$M candidates to obtain their dynamic signature sequences. By comparing signature sequences, BinSeeker produces top-$N$N functions that exhibit most similar behavior to that of the vulnerability. With fast filtering of semantic learning and accurate comparison of semantic emulation, BinSeeker seeks vulnerability precisely with little overhead. The experiments on six widely used programs with fifteen known CVE vulnerabilities demonstrate that BinSeeker outperforms three state-of-the-art tools Genius, Gemini and CACompare. Regarding search accuracy, BinSeeker achieves an MRR value of 0.65 in the target programs, whereas the MRR values by Genius, Gemini and CACompare are 0.17, 0.07 and 0.42, respectively. If we consider ranking a function with the targeted vulnerability in the top-5 as accurate, BinSeeker achieves the accuracy of 93.33 percent, while the accuracy of the other three tools is merely 33.33, 13.33 and 53.33 percent, respectively. Such accuracy is achieved with 0.27s on average to determine whether the target binary function contains a known vulnerability, and the time for the other three tools are 1.57s, 0.15s and 0.98s, respectively. Compared to the time used to manually identify the true positive vulnerability from the false positive candidates reported by Gemini, the time overhead of BinSeeker is negligible. Evidently, the proposed BinSeeker achieves a better balance between accuracy and efficiency.",1939-3520,,10.1109/TSE.2019.2956932,National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61527812); National Science and Technology Major Project of China(grant numbers:2016ZX01038101);,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8918305,Semantic emulation;semantic learning;cross-platform binary;vulnerability search;neural network,Drilling machines;Process control;Automation;Rocks;Tools,learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;operating systems (computers);program compilers;program diagnostics;security of data,BinSeeker;semantic learning;software vulnerability search;semantic emulation;cross-platform binary vulnerability seeker;clone detection;source code analysis;binary clone detection;operating systems;microprocessor architectures;compilers;labeled semantic flow graph;dynamic signature sequences;Genius tool;Gemini tool;CACompare tool;efficiency 53.33 percent;time 0.27 s;time 5.0 as;time 0.98 s;time 1.57 s;efficiency 93.33 percent;time 0.15 s,,3.0,,47.0,IEEE,2 Dec 2019,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals,False,True,True,True

This paper proposes constructing the code property graph from a program’s lifted machine code to observe structural differences between other executables. We implement our approach with the Binary Ninja Intermediate Language (BNIL) and the graph2vec neural embedding framework to create embedded representations of the graphical properties of the program. Downstream applications, such as supervised machine learning, can then analyze these representations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by training a supervised random forest classifier on the embedded graphs to determine, at the function level, which compiler, clang or gcc, created the executable the function belongs to. Our results achieved an accuracy of 100% across our testing set of 25,600 samples.",,978-1-6654-7408-5,10.1109/TPS-ISA56441.2022.00039,Research and Development; ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10063699,compiler;code property graph;static analysis;Binary Ninja;graph2vec,Training;Codes;Program processors;Source coding;Semantics;Static analysis;Security,data analysis;graph theory;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;pattern classification;program compilers;program diagnostics;random forests;source code (software),Binary Ninja Intermediate Language;clang;code property graph;compiler information;embedded graphs;executable machine code;graph2vec neural embedding framework;graphical properties;lifted machine code;security properties;source code languages;static analysis testing;supervised machine learning;underlying source code,,,,48.0,IEEE,15 Mar 2023,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,False,True,True,

As a result, smart contracts have been targeted by cyber attackers for the purpose of cryptocurrency theft. The smart contract honeypot is a commonly used attack method. An attacker who makes a honeypot lures other weak attackers who target vulnerable contracts by seeming to have exploitable flaws. The honeypot attacker then steals cryptocurrency from the weak attackers using a hidden trap. In this paper, we propose a machine-learning model that can detect such honeypots with high performance and prevent theft before it occurs. We use a term-frequency inverse document-frequency method to extract feature words and word2vec to learn distributed representations for the Solidity bytecode. As a result, we achieved higher PR-AUC scores in honeypot detection compared with previous efforts. Based on this, we demonstrate that the smart contract code contains useful information for honeypot detection. Furthermore, our proposed method works without using features that become available after theft.

The constant increase of threats and vulnerabilities raises the need to handle vulnerabilities in a prioritized manner. This prioritization can be achieved through Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), typically used to assign a score to a vulnerability. However, there is a temporal mismatch between the vulnerability finding and score assignment, which motivates the development of approaches to aid in this aspect. We explore the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) models in CVSS score prediction given vulnerability descriptions. We start by creating a vulnerability dataset from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). Then, we combine text pre-processing and vocabulary addition to improve the model accuracy and interpret its prediction reasoning by assessing word importance, via Shapley values. Experiments show that the combination of Lemmatization and 5,000-word addition is optimal for DistilBERT, the outperforming model in our experiments of the NLP methods, achieving state-of-the-art results. Furthermore, specific events (such as an attack on a known software) tend to influence model prediction, which may hinder CVSS prediction. Combining Lemmatization with vocabulary addition mitigates this effect, contributing to increased accuracy. Finally, binary classes benefit the most from pre-processing techniques, particularly when one class is much more prominent than the other. Our work demonstrates that DistilBERT is a state-of-the-art model for CVSS prediction, demonstrating the applicability of deep learning approaches to aid in vulnerability handling.

Compared to offloading deep learning from smartphones to the cloud, on-device deep learning enables offline model inference while preserving user privacy. However, such mechanisms inevitably store models on users’ smartphones and may invite adversarial attacks as they are accessible to attackers. Due to the characteristic of the on-device model, most existing adversarial attacks cannot be directly applied for on-device models. In this paper, we introduce a grey-box adversarial attack framework to hack on-device models by crafting highly similar binary classification models based on identified transfer learning approaches and pre-trained models from TensorFlow Hub. We evaluate the attack effectiveness and generality in terms of four different settings including pre-trained models, datasets, transfer learning approaches and adversarial attack algorithms. The results demonstrate that the proposed attacks remain effective regardless of different settings, and significantly outperform state-of-the-art baselines. We further conduct an empirical study on real-world deep learning mobile apps collected from Google Play. Among 53 apps adopting transfer learning, we find that 71.7% of them can be successfully attacked, which includes popular ones in medicine, automation, and finance categories with critical usage scenarios.

This reality warrants development of tools and techniques to analyze android apps in large scale for security vetting. Most of the state-of-the-art vetting tools are either based on static analysis or on dynamic analysis. Static analysis has limited success if the malware app utilizes sophisticated evading tricks. Dynamic analysis on the other hand may not find all the code execution paths, which let some malware apps remain undetected. Moreover, the existing static and dynamic analysis vetting techniques require extensive human interaction. To address the above issues, we design a deep learning based hybrid analysis technique, which combines the complementary strengths of each analysis paradigm to attain better accuracy. Moreover, automated feature engineering capability of the deep learning framework addresses the human interaction issue. In particular, using lightweight static and dynamic analysis procedure, we obtain multiple artifacts, and with these artifacts we train the deep learner to create independent models, and then combine them to build a hybrid classifier to obtain the final vetting decision (malicious apps vs. benign apps). The experiments show that our best deep learning model with hybrid analysis achieves an area under the precision-recall curve (AUC) of 0.9998. In this paper, we also present a comparative study of performance measures of the various variants of the deep learning framework.

Recent success of ML and Deep Learning (DL) based NIDS solutions assume such flow information (<italic>e.g.,</italic> avg. packet size) is obtained from all packets of the flow. However, often in practice flow exporter is deployed on commodity devices where packet sampling is inevitable. As a result, applicability of such ML based NIDS solutions in the presence of sampling (<italic>i.e.,</italic> when flow information is obtained from sampled set of packets instead of full traffic) is an open question. In this study, we explore the impact of packet sampling on the performance and efficiency of ML-based NIDSs. Unlike previous work, our proposed evaluation procedure is immune to different settings of flow export stage. Hence, it can provide a robust evaluation of NIDS even in the presence of sampling. Through sampling experiments we established that malicious flows with shorter size (<italic>i.e.,</italic> number of packets) are likely to go unnoticed even with mild sampling rates such as 1/10 and 1/100. Next, using the proposed evaluation procedure we investigated the impact of various sampling techniques on NIDS detection rate and false alarm rate. Detection rate and false alarm rate is computed for three sampling rates (<italic>i.e.,</italic> 1/10, 1/100, 1/1000), for four different sampling techniques and for three (two tree-based, one deep learning based) classifiers. Experimental results show that systematic linear sampler - SketFlow performs better compared to non-linear samplers such as Sketch Guided and Fast Filtered sampling. We also found that random forest classifier with SketchFlow sampling was a better combination. The combination showed higher detection rate and lower false alarm rate across multiple sampling rates compared to other sampler-classifier combinations. Our results are consistent in multiple sampling rates, exceptional case is observed for Sketch Guided Sampling (SGS) as it caused a drastic performance drop when sampling rate was changed from 1/100 to 1/1000. Our results provide valuable insights for network practitioners and researchers regarding on how packet sampling effects ML-based NIDS performance.

This type of noise in the scenario of multiple languages in a multilingual code-mixed corpus and identifying particular language at the sentence level is problematic because it involves various forms of a single language. i.e., code-mixed sentences involve different languages and are written in the Roman script and the native script. In this paper, we address the solution to the language identification problem in the Gujarati code-mixed script in which the Gujarati language is written in various forms, i.e., romanized and non-romanized forms. In the context of the current problem, we first time created our own dataset and for experiment we have used a large dataset for the Gujarati language in which Gujarati mixed-up with Hindi and English.

Exniffer: Learning to Prioritize Crashes by Assessing the Exploitability from Memory Dump,S. Tripathi; G. Grieco; S.

A program crash is an early indicator of possible errors in the program like memory corruption, access violation or division by zero. In particular, a crash may indicate the presence of safety or security critical errors. A safety-error crash does not result in any exploitable condition, whereas a security-error crash allows an attacker to exploit a vulnerability. However, distinguishing one from the other is a non-trivial task. This exacerbates the problem in cases where we get hundreds of crashes and programmers have to make choices which crash to patch first! In this work, we present a technique to identify security critical crashes by applying machine learning on a set of features derived from core-dump files and runtime information obtained from hardware assisted monitoring such as the last branch record (LBR) register. We implement the proposed technique in a prototype called Exniffer.

Interpretable linear models for predicting security vulnerabilities in source code,T. D. Hocking; J. R. Barr; T.

There are an increasing number of attacks on such code using unpatched security vulnerabilities. Therefore, it is important to create tools that can automatically identify or predict security vulnerabilities in code, in order to prevent such attacks. In this paper we focus on methods for predicting security vulnerabilities based on analysis of the source code as a text file. In recent years many attempts to solve this problem involve natural language processing (NLP) methods which use neural networks-based techniques where tokens in the source code are mapped into a vector in a Euclidean space which has dimension much lower than the dimensionality of the encoding of tokens. Those embedding-type methods were shown effective solving problems like sentence completion, indexing large corpora of texts, classifying & organizing documents and more. However, it is often necessary to extract an interpretation for which features are important for the decision rule of the learned model. A weakness of neural networks-based methods is lack of such interpretability. In this paper we show how L1 regularized linear models can be used with engineered features, in order to supplement neural network embedding features. Our approach yields models which are more interpretable and more accurate than models which only use neural network based feature embeddings. Our empirical results in cross-validation experiments show that the linear models with interpretable features are significantly more accurate than models with neural network embedding features alone. We additionally show that nearly all of the features were used in the learned models, and that trained models generalize to some extent to other data sets.",,978-1-6654-7184-8,10.1109/TransAI54797.2022.00032,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9951610,vulnerability detection;static code analysis;interpretable linear models;L1 regularization,Analytical models;Codes;Source coding;Neural networks;Predictive models;Feature extraction;Natural language processing,computer crime;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;source code (software);text analysis,attack prevention;computer code;interpretable features;interpretable linear models;L1 regularized linear models;neural network embedding features;security vulnerabilities;source code;text file,,,,20.0,IEEE,18 Nov 2022,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,False,True,True,

In particular, third-party tracking is a major factor affecting privacy security. So far, the most effective way to prevent third-party tracking is to create a blacklist. However, blacklist generation and maintenance need to be carried out manually which is inefficient and difficult to maintain. In order to generate blacklists more quickly and accurately in this era of big data, this paper proposes a machine learning system MFTrackerDetector against third-party tracking. The system is based on the theory of structural hole and only detects third-party trackers. The system consists of two subsystems, DMTrackerDetector and DFTrackerDetector. DMTrackerDetector is a JavaScript-based subsystem and DFTrackerDetector is a Flash-based subsystem. Because tracking code and non-tracking code often call different APIs, DMTrackerDetector builds a classifier using all the APIs in JavaScript as features and extracts the API features in JavaScript through dynamic analysis. Unlike static analysis method, the dynamic analysis method can effectively avoid code obfuscation. DMTrackerDetector eventually generates a JavaScript-based third-party tracker list named Jlist. DFTrackerDetector constructs a classifier using all the APIs in ActionScript as features and extracts the API features in the flash script through static analysis. DFTrackerDetector finally generates a Flash-based third-party tracker list named Flist. DFTrackerDetector achieved 92.98% accuracy in the Flash test set and DMTrackerDetector achieved 90.79% accuracy in the JavaScript test set.

Early detection of vulnerable code during development can better ensure the security of the codebase and minimize testing efforts. Although traditional software metrics are used for early detection of vulnerabilities, they do not clearly address the granularity level of the issue to precisely pinpoint vulnerabilities. The goal of this study is to employ method-level traceable patterns (nano-patterns) in vulnerability prediction and empirically compare their performance with traditional software metrics. The concept of nano-patterns is similar to design patterns, but these constructs can be automatically recognized and extracted from source code. If nano-patterns can better predict vulnerable methods compared to software metrics, they can be used in developing vulnerability prediction models with better accuracy. Aims: This study explores the performance of method-level patterns in vulnerability prediction. We also compare them with method-level software metrics. Method: We studied vulnerabilities reported for two major releases of Apache Tomcat (6 and 7), Apache CXF, and two stand-alone Java web applications. We used three machine learning techniques to predict vulnerabilities using nano-patterns as features. We applied the same techniques using method-level software metrics as features and compared their performance with nano-patterns. Results: We found that nano-patterns show lower false negative rates for classifying vulnerable methods (for Tomcat 6, 21% vs 34.7%) and therefore, have higher recall in predicting vulnerable code than the software metrics used. On the other hand, software metrics show higher precision than nano-patterns (79.4% vs 76.6%).

In order to reduce the attack surface, one approach is to analyze the binary code of these devices to early detect whether they contain potential security vulnerabilities. More specifically, knowing some vulnerable function, we can determine whether the firmware of an IoT device contains some security flaw by searching for this function. However, searching for similar vulnerable functions is in general challenging due to the fact that the source code is often not openly available and that it can be compiled for different architectures, using different compilers and compilation settings. In order to handle these varying settings, we can compare the similarity between the graph embeddings derived from the binary functions. In this paper, inspired by the recent advances in deep learning, we propose a new method – GESS (graph embeddings for similarity search) – to derive graph embeddings, and we compare it with various state-of-the-art methods. Our empirical evaluation shows that GESS reaches an AUC of 0.979, thereby outperforming the best known approach. Furthermore, for a fixed low false positive rate, GESS provides a true positive rate (or recall) about 36% higher than the best previous approach.

Most of the coverage-based fuzzers consider all parts of a program equally and pay too much attention to how to improve the code coverage. It is inefficient as the vulnerable code only takes a tiny fraction of the entire code. In this article, we design and implement an evolutionary fuzzing framework called V-Fuzz, which aims to find bugs efficiently and quickly in limited time for binary programs. V-Fuzz consists of two main components: 1) a vulnerability prediction model and 2) a vulnerability-oriented evolutionary fuzzer. Given a binary program to V-Fuzz, the vulnerability prediction model will give a prior estimation on which parts of a program are more likely to be vulnerable. Then, the fuzzer leverages an evolutionary algorithm to generate inputs which are more likely to arrive at the vulnerable locations, guided by the vulnerability prediction result. The experimental results demonstrate that V-Fuzz can find bugs efficiently with the assistance of vulnerability prediction.

An assembly clone search engine facilitates the work of reverse engineers by identifying those duplicated or known parts. However, it is challenging to design a robust clone search engine, since there exist various compiler optimization options and code obfuscation techniques that make logically similar assembly functions appear to be very different. A practical clone search engine relies on a robust vector representation of assembly code. However, the existing clone search approaches, which rely on a manual feature engineering process to form a feature vector for an assembly function, fail to consider the relationships between features and identify those unique patterns that can statistically distinguish assembly functions. To address this problem, we propose to jointly learn the lexical semantic relationships and the vector representation of assembly functions based on assembly code. We have developed an assembly code representation learning model \emph{Asm2Vec}. It only needs assembly code as input and does not require any prior knowledge such as the correct mapping between assembly functions. It can find and incorporate rich semantic relationships among tokens appearing in assembly code. We conduct extensive experiments and benchmark the learning model with state-of-the-art static and dynamic clone search approaches.

With the number of attacks launched on computer networks and software, businesses and IT professionals are taking steps to ensure that their information systems are as secure as possible. However, many programmers do not think about adding security to their programs until their projects are near completion. This is a major mistake because a system is as secure as its weakest link. If security is viewed as an afterthought, it is highly likely that the resulting system will have a large number of vulnerabilities, which could be exploited by attackers. One of the reasons programmers overlook adding security to their code is because it is viewed as a complicated or time-consuming process. This paper presents a tool that will help programmers think more about security and add security tactics to their code with ease. We created a model that learns from existing open source projects and documentation using machine learning and text mining techniques.

While they are found to be effective in detecting vulnerabilities, the consequences are often expensive. Accommodating changes after detecting a vulnerability in the system in later stages of the SDLC is very costly, sometimes even infeasible as it may involve changes in design or architecture. Moreover, the root of a vulnerability can often be traced back to the requirements specification.

However, due to the multisource heterogeneity of IoT devices, there are significant differences between the vulnerability detection of the Internet of Things and the PC-based vulnerability search method. Therefore, determining how to accurate search for vulnerabilities in large-scale cross-platform binary executable files is an urgent problem to be solved. At present, the solution to this problem mostly calculates code similarities by generating a CFG (control flow graph) from binary code, but due to the choice of architecture, OS (operating system) or compilation options, the same source code will be compiled into different assembly codes. The performance of existing vulnerability search methods for cross-architecture binaries has been challenged. To alleviate the vast differences in the assembly codes caused by different compilation scenarios, this paper proposes a cross-platform large-scale binary vulnerability search method based on two-level feature semantic learning. The contribution is that we have defined a new functional structured signature method to mitigate the massive grammatical and structural differences of binary files caused by different compilation environments.

Nonetheless, the training process required of privacy-sensitive applications needs to protect data confidentiality and simultaneously boost performance using limited training data. For such data-deprived and privacy-centric learning, we introduce a trustless federated learning framework that seamlessly integrates deep learning models from different edge nodes using a blockchain-based architecture. Our framework performs federated learning without the need of a central server by leveraging a smart contract blockchain platform with a distributed file system for model storage.

CAG combines the principles of different code analyses such as abstract syntax tree, control flow graph, and program dependence graph with dominator and post-dominator trees. This extensive representation empowers deep graph networks for enhanced classification. We also implement different data encoding methods and neural networks to provide a multidimensional view of the system performance. Specifically, three word embedding approaches and three deep GNNs are utilized to build classifiers. Then CAG is evaluated using two datasets: a real-world open-source dataset and the software assurance reference dataset.

An important part of that problem derives from vulnerable source code, often written in unsafe languages like PHP. Source code static analysis tools are a solution to find vulnerabilities, but they tend to generate false positives, and require considerable effort for programmers to manually fix the code. We explore the use of a combination of methods to discover vulnerabilities in source code with fewer false positives. We combine taint analysis, which finds candidate vulnerabilities, with data mining, to predict the existence of false positives. This approach brings together two approaches that are apparently orthogonal: humans coding the knowledge about vulnerabilities (for taint analysis), joined with the seemingly orthogonal approach of automatically obtaining that knowledge (with machine learning, for data mining). Given this enhanced form of detection, we propose doing automatic code correction by inserting fixes in the source code. Our approach was implemented in the WAP tool, and an experimental evaluation was performed with a large set of PHP applications. Our tool found 388 vulnerabilities in 1.4 million lines of code.

What makes things more challenging and interesting for the Android Developers and security experts is the fact that various versions of Android Operating System, from Android 2.3.3 (Ginger Bread) to Android 11.0 coexist in this ecosystem. This paper discusses threats that emanate from Hybrid Android Apps. These Hybrid Apps use WebView Component for handling web content within Android Apps. WebView allows HTML and JavaScript to run and render webpages inside Apps, thereby allowing them to download content from Web Servers on the Internet. It is used by several popular Apps, like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc. WebView even allows JavaScript code to call Android code for completing various tasks. While this feature gives tremendous capability to create interactive Hybrid Apps, however, it also opens a route for malicious content to infect the Android Platform using targeted JavaScript based malwares. Any malicious JavaScript, from untrusted or even from trusted source, can thus find its way to exploit this unique linkage with Android Platform. In this paper we analyze Android Web View's security vulnerabilities, access authorization, kind of attacks that it can encounter, and mechanisms to prevent these attacks.

However, the use of obfuscation technology, which is originally aimed at optimizing code and protecting intellectual property, has become a kind of threat in this type of detection method because both static features and dynamic features might be influenced by obfuscation, which has a negative impact on efficacy of models based on these features.

HARMLESS is an incremental support vector machine tool that builds a vulnerability prediction model from the source code inspected to date, then suggests what source code files should be inspected next. In this way, HARMLESS can reduce the time and effort required to achieve some desired level of recall for finding vulnerabilities. The tool also provides feedback on when to stop (at that desired level of recall) while at the same time, correcting human errors by double-checking suspicious files. This paper evaluates HARMLESS on Mozilla Firefox vulnerability data. HARMLESS found 80, 90, 95, 99 percent of the vulnerabilities by inspecting 10, 16, 20, 34 percent of the source code files.

Code virtualization has been successfully applied to programming languages like C, C++, and Java. However, it remains an outstanding challenge to apply this promising technique to JavaScript, a popular web programming language. This is primarily due to the open visibility of JavaScript code and the expensive runtime overhead associated with code virtualization. This paper presents JSPro, a novel code virtualization system for JavaScript. JSPro is the first JavaScript code obfuscation tool that builds upon the emerging WebAssembly language standard. It is designed to provide more secure code protection but without incurring a significant runtime penalty, explicitly targeting numerical JavaScript kernels. We achieve this by first automatically translating the target JavaScript code into WebAssembly and then performing code obfuscation on the compiled WebAssembly binary.

We evaluate JSPro on a set of numerical JavaScript algorithms widely used in many applications. To test the performance, we apply JSPro to four mainstream web browsers running on three distinct mobile devices.

Many researchers have proposed attack methods to break them. In previous attacks, segmentation-based methods require at least three steps: preprocessing, segmentation, and recognition, which means that different modes of CAPTCHA require various preprocessing and segmentation algorithms. In recent years, a series of deep learning (DL) models have been designed for cracking text-based CAPTCHAs. However, these methods require annotating numerous images, which are time-consuming and labor-intensive. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised DL-based solver for breaking text-based CAPTCHAs, which can use a small number of labeled CAPTCHAs to achieve a high-performance attack model. The CNN module and the attention-based Seq2Seq module are two key components for effective feature extraction and character recognition. The experimental results show that our solver successfully attacked 9 types of most popular text-based CAPTCHAs, and the attack success rate is better than the four latest attack models.

Many existing works compute the code similarity based on CFGs to determine whether a binary function contains a known vulnerability. Unfortunately, their performance in cross-platform binary search is challenged. This paper presents VulSeeker, a semantic learning based vulnerability seeker for cross-platform binary. Given a target function and a vulnerable function, VulSeeker first constructs the labeled semantic flow graphs and extracts basic block features as numerical vectors for both of them. Then the embedding vector of the whole binary function is generated by feeding the numerical vectors of basic blocks to the customized semantics aware DNN model. Finally, the similarity of the two binary functions is measured based on the Cosine distance. The experimental results show that VulSeeker outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of accuracy. For example, compared to the most recent and related work Gemini, VulSeeker finds 50.00% more vulnerabilities in the top-10 candidates and 13.89% more in the top-50 candidates, and improves the values of AUC and ACC for 8.23% and 12.14% respectively.

Two significant issues in SVD arise when using machine learning, namely: i) how to learn automatic features that can help improve the predictive performance of vulnerability detection and ii) how to overcome the scarcity of labeled vulnerabilities in projects that require the laborious labeling of code by software security experts. In this paper, we address these two crucial concerns by proposing a novel architecture which leverages deep domain adaptation with automatic feature learning for software vulnerability identification. Based on this architecture, we keep the principles and reapply the state-of-the-art deep domain adaptation methods to indicate that deep domain adaptation for SVD is plausible and promising.

In this project, we propose to use a touch pad to construct a HAM radio interface. Low-power, short-range wireless communication interfaces which have become available with modern microcontrollers enable the construction of such systems which can allow users to exchange information within buildings. While Morse code was invented for telegraphy, its simplicity allows a person with physical disability to use it more effectively than a keyboard-based interface. Thus, such an interface can be useful in rehab centers, old-age homes and hospitals. Security systems are yet another domain where Morse code can be gainfully employed. Since the user must make use of touch, drag and release operations for Morse code signaling, it is difficult to prescribe any strict guidelines on the length of the drag or the time gap between two drags. Multiple users of the system will use the system at different speeds. We propose the use of Fuzzy logic with elements of machine learning to reduce the chances of misinterpreting the Morse code and adapting to different users.

NPD vulnerability can be exploited by hackers to maliciously crash a process to cause a denial of service or execute an arbitrary code under specific conditions. This typical taint-style vulnerability requires an accurate data dependency analysis to trace whether a source is propagated to a sensitive sink without proper sanitization. The primary challenge in data dependency analysis is pointer aliasing, which may significantly affect the vulnerability detection accuracy. Although there have been many studies and open-source tools, they still have limitations when detecting a real-world binary. In this paper, we propose a static binary analysis approach to detect an NPD vulnerability. To improve detection accuracy and practicality, we first identify two challenges that affect the accuracy of binary NPD detection: (i) pointer aliasing, and (ii) untrusted source identification.

Taint analysis in particular is a very general and powerful technique, where security policies are expressed in terms of forbidden flows, either from untrusted input sources to sensitive sinks (in integrity policies) or from sensitive sources to untrusted sinks (in confidentiality policies). The appeal of this approach is that the taint-tracking mechanism has to be implemented only once, and can then be parameterized with different taint specifications (that is, sets of sources and sinks, as well as any sanitizers that render otherwise problematic flows innocuous) to detect many different kinds of vulnerabilities. But while techniques for implementing scalable inter-procedural static taint tracking are fairly well established, crafting taint specifications is still more of an art than a science, and in practice tends to involve a lot of manual effort. Past work has focussed on automated techniques for inferring taint specifications for libraries either from their implementation or from the way they tend to be used in client code. Among the latter, machine learning-based approaches have shown great promise. In this work we present our experience combining an existing machine-learning approach to mining sink specifications for JavaScript libraries with manual taint modelling in the context of GitHub's CodeQL analysis framework. We show that the machine-learning component can successfully infer many new taint sinks that either are not part of the manual modelling or are not detected due to analysis incompleteness.

Thus, some operational security mechanisms have been designed to deal with malicious code in SDN. However, most of those approaches require a signature basis and present the inability to anticipate novel malicious activity. Other anomaly based approaches are inefficient due to the possibility of an attacker simulates legitimate traffic, which causes lots of false alarms. Thus, in this paper, we present an anomaly based approaches that uses machine learning algorithms over continuous data stream for intrusion detection in a SDN environment. Our approach is to overcome the main challenges that happen when developing an anomaly based system using machine learning algorithms. For characterising the anomalies, we have analysed a type of DDoS attack classified as infrastructure attack that considers the impact of both bandwidth and resource depletions. This type of attack imposes a high affect to the whole SDN. In fact, there are two types of attacks. The bandwidth depletion attack targets the channel between the switches and the controller through either UDP or HTTP flooding. Another way to exhaust outgoing and ingoing bandwidths is through ICMP flooding. The resource depletion attack attempts to exhaust the flow table of switches through SYN flooding.

Detecting malware in the Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructures is a critical and complicated task. The complexity of this task increases with the recent growth of malware variants targeting different IoT CPU architectures since the new malware variants often use anti-forensic techniques to avoid detection and investigation. There-fore, we cannot utilize the traditional machine learning (ML) techniques that require domain knowledge and sophisticated feature engineering in detecting the unseen mal ware variants. Re-cent deep learning approaches have performed well on mal ware analysis and detection while using minimum feature engineering requirements. In this paper, we propose BERTDeep- Ware, a real-time cross-architecture malware detection solution tailored for IoT systems.

This deep learning (DL) model combines the convolutional neural network (CNN), bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM), and the local attention mechanisms (locAtt) to capture contextual features and long-term dependencies between OpCode sequences.

This paper addresses this cold-start problem of machine learning, by learning rich features that generalize across similar projects. To reach an optimal balance between feature-richness and generalizability, we devise a data-driven method including the following innovative ideas. First, the code semantics are revealed through serialized abstract syntax trees (ASTs), with tokens encoded by Continuous Bag-of-Words neural embeddings. Next, the serialized ASTs are fed to a sequential deep learning classifier (Bi-LSTM) to obtain a representation indicative of software vulnerability. Finally, the neural representation obtained from existing software projects is then transferred to the new project to enable early vulnerability detection even with a small set of training labels. To validate this vulnerability detection approach, we manually labeled 457 vulnerable functions and collected 30 000+ nonvulnerable functions from six open-source projects. The empirical results confirmed that the trained model is capable of generating representations that are indicative of program vulnerability and is adaptable across multiple projects.

In this paper we propose a deep learning approach to detecting malevolent web pages. While past work on web content detection has relied on syntactic parsing or on emulation of HTML and Javascript to extract features, our approach operates directly on a language-agnostic stream of tokens extracted directly from static HTML files with a simple regular expression. This makes it fast enough to operate in high-frequency data contexts like firewalls and web proxies, and allows it to avoid the attack surface exposure of complex parsing and emulation code. Unlike well-known approaches such as bag-of-words models, which ignore spatial information, our neural network examines content at hierarchical spatial scales, allowing our model to capture locality and yielding superior accuracy compared to bag-of-words baselines. Our proposed architecture achieves a 97.5% detection rate at a 0.1% false positive rate, and classifies small-batched web pages at a rate of over 100 per second on commodity hardware.

It is thus important to understand the capabilities of an attacker to identify homoglyphs - particularly ones that have not been previously spotted - and leverage them in attacks. We investigate a deep-learning model using embedding learning, transfer learning, and augmentation to determine the visual similarity of characters and thereby identify potential homoglyphs. Our approach uniquely takes advantage of weak labels that arise from the fact that most characters are not homoglyphs. Our model drastically outperforms the Normal-ized Compression Distance approach on pairwise homoglyph identification, for which we achieve an average precision of 0.97. We also present the first attempt at clustering homoglyphs into sets of equivalence classes, which is more efficient than pairwise information for security practitioners to quickly lookup homoglyphs or to normalize confusable string encodings. To measure clustering performance, we propose a metric (mBIOU) building on the classic Intersection-Over-Union (IOU) metric. Our clustering method achieves 0.592 mBIOU, compared to 0.430 for the naive baseline.

Information security: The SCAN — Secure processor with crypto-biometrics capabilities,N. Bourbakis,"Wright State University, USA",2010 International Conference on e-Business (ICE-B),28 Mar 2011,2010.0,,,IS-11,IS-11,"Secure computing is gaining importance in recent times as computing capability is increasingly becoming distributed and information is everywhere. Prevention of piracy and digital rights management has become very important. Information security is mandatory rather than an additional feature. Numerous software techniques have been proposed to provide certain level of copyright and intellectual property protection. Techniques like obfuscation attempts to transform the code into a form that is harder to reverse engineer. Tamper-proofing causes a program to malfunction when it detects that it has been modified. Software watermarking embeds copyright notice in the software code to allow the owners of the software to assert their intellectual property rights. The software techniques discourage software theft, can trace piracy, prove ownership, but cannot prevent copying itself. Thus, software based security firewalls and encryption is not completely safe from determined hackers. This necessitates the need for information security at the hardware level, where secure processors assume importance. In this talk the SCAN-Secure Processor is presented as a possible solution to these important issues mentioned above. The SCAN-SP is a modified Sparc V8 processor architecture with a new instruction set to handle image compression, encryption, information hiding and biometric authentication. A SCAN based methodology for encryption and decryption of 32 bit instructions and data and a Local-Global graph based methodology for biometric authentication is presented.

Recent studies have focused on the critical principle of Block chain and how it may be used in areas such as data protection change, food safety, product growth, and business acceleration in all retail establishments. The approach includes genuine features in security architecture to prevent low levels and counterfeit medications. Even at the level of individual stocks, Block chain will ensure compliance with the acquisition of any goods by improving evidence of ownership through the use of particular sources. The strategy includes genuine variables inside the security systems to prevent low-tier and counterfeit pharmaceuticals. Even at the level of individual stocks, Block chain will ensure compliance with the acquisition of any goods by strengthening evidence of ownership via the use of unique sources. Because every time a product changes hands, transactions can be recorded and verified using a unique ID known as the EPC code, which is issued remotely using FSSAI, from its production to sales, and is clearly called Block chain. it does not change, it provides consistency and meaning. When the block is finished, generate a fully unique code that binds to the next page or inhibits the appearance of a series of blocks. Because the concept is entirely based on a reliable cryptographic hash algorithm, the transaction cannot be copied or encrypted, copies are equivalent, and minimal authorization is required to gain access to the data. This will significantly eliminate human errors, additional expenses, and time delays and might be a global procurement application. The suggested system uses the K- Nearest Neighbour algorithm to monitor food production from farmers through distributors, who then sell it to customers. Expired stock can be reclaimed and redistributed after special authorization by bodies. Notify customers regarding product performance as well. FSSAI provides the EPC code, which may be found in every product from manufacture to wholesaler to retailer.

To date, there exist two categories of SCS methods: information retrieval (IR)-based SCS and neural-based SCS. The latter is the mainstream method at present, however, this line of work suffers from the drawback of incapability to generate low-frequency words, which potentially degrades the performance. To tackle this predicament, we in this paper propose an IR-enhanced neural SCS method RetCom to improve the prediction of low-frequency words through leveraging both structural-level and semantic-level code retrievals. Furthermore, we figure out a token-level context-dependent mixture network to fuse different information sources, i.e. original code, structurally most similar code, and semantically most similar code. Finally, extensive experiments are performed to validate our proposed RetCom using two real-world datasets. Compared to several baseline methods, the experimental results show that our method does validly capture more low-frequency words to conduct a superior performance.",2693-9177,978-1-6654-7704-8,10.1109/QRS57517.2022.00099,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10062384,Source-code summarization;deep learning;information retrieval,Codes;Fuses;Source coding;Software quality;Information retrieval;Software reliability;Security,information retrieval;natural language processing;software engineering;source code (software),information retrieval-based SCS;information retrieval-enhanced automatic source-code summarization;information sources;IR-enhanced neural;low-frequency words;neural-based SCS;RetCom;semantic-level code retrievals;token-level context-dependent mixture network,,,,37.0,IEEE,20 Mar 2023,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,False,True,True,

Privacypreserving machine learning method based on the concept of model training isolated from data scientists have become a hot topic in recent years. In order to protect data privacy, training data is completely isolated from data scientists. Although this method can protect data privacy, data scientists cannot perceive any training information of data nodes during training, and it is difficult to debug machine learning model. Existing works provide data collection APIs to collect and display metadata during training to help data scientists debug machine learning models. Malicious data scientists can obtain private data through these APIs. In this paper, a novel security machine learning debug tool based non-intrusive metadata collection scheme, called SecureMLDebugger(SMLD), is proposed, which automatically collect, store and manage non-privacy metadata during training without any data collection API. Our tool accelerates users in their machine learning experiment while protecting data privacy. We achieve this by transparently tracing each function call in machine learning code and automatically extracting metadata such as hyperparameters of models, training runs, evaluations and layouts of neural networks.

Cyberspace security is attracting more and more attention. Therefore, detecting malware and its variants is of great significance to Cyberspace. However, the increasing sophistication of malicious variants, such as encryption, polymorphism and obfuscation, makes it more difficult to identified malware effectively. In this article, a malware detection method of code texture visualization based on an improved Faster RCNN (Region-Convolutional Neural Networks) combining transfer learning is proposed. We utilize visualization technology to map malicious code into corresponding images with typical texture features, and realize the classification of malware. Firstly, in order to quickly acquire and locate the representative texture of malware, we adopt CNN to extract the global and deeper features of malicious code images. Then with RPN (Region Proposal Network) we generate the target image frame, which is used to locate the core texture of malware file (.text file), to realize the accurate positioning of malicious features. Secondly, we preprocess and train Faster RCNN model with ImageNet set, and then transfer the model to the malware classification model to accelerate the convergence of the first model and promote generation performance. Thirdly, we construct an improved objective function in which a novel multi-label of classification proportion is added to solve the problem that the texture change of “.text” section and other sections in malicious code image is not obvious after transfer learning. We collect code samples of six malware families from Kaggle platform, and compared the experimental results before and after transfer.

RFID tags are a powerful mechanism for object identification, and can facilitate the compilation of detailed object histories and pedigrees. Since RFID tags communicate with the reader through open air in an automated, wireless manner, they are poor authenticators. Furthermore, they have a small microchip on board that offer functionality that can be used for security purposes. This chip functionality makes it possible to verify the authenticity of a product and hence to detect and prevent counterfeiting. In order to be successful for these security purposes, RFID tags have to be resistant against many attacks, in particular against cloning of the tag. Therefore, RFID tags are vulnerable to elementary cloning and counterfeiting attacks. In this paper, we survey and remedy the technologies used for RFID tags against counterfeiting.

Attacks against the control code of a power-grid system, especially zero-day attacks, can be catastrophic. Earlier detection of the anomalies can prevent further damage. However, detecting zero-day attacks is extremely challenging because they have no known code and have unknown behavior. Furthermore, if data collected from the controller is transferred to a server through networks for analysis and detection of anomalous behavior, this creates a very large attack surface and also delays detection. In order to address this problem, we propose Reconstruction Error Distribution (RED) of Hardware Performance Counters (HPCs), and a data-driven defense system based on it. Specifically, we first train a temporal deep learning model, using only normal HPC readings from legitimate processes that run daily in these power-grid systems, to model the normal behavior of the power-grid controller. Then, we run this model using real-time data from commonly available HPCs. We use the proposed RED to enhance the temporal deep learning detection of anomalous behavior, by estimating distribution deviations from the normal behavior with an effective statistical test.

However, this has also led to an increased number of malware attacks targeting Android. To counter this, various anti-malware systems and techniques are available nowadays that offer strong protection to users. The existence and deployment of malware detection models, such as antiviruses, are still made futile by the attackers modifying the code and creating more malware that evades the capability of the detection tools. This presents a larger threat to users' sensitive data by the malware, and that could further lead to data manipulation. This paper aims to contribute to achieving a more secure software engineering experience for Android users by proposing a lightweight tool that enables users to detect such malware more easily and, in turn, protect their overall data security and privacy. The permissions sought by the applications for their functionality are used in this paper to identify and detect such Android malware.

Machine learning classifiers are widely used to model Android malware patterns based on their static features and dynamic behaviour. To address the problem of malware detection, in this paper we have proposed a machine learning-based malware detection system for Android platform.

Two key issues are mainly addressed: (i) how to perform attacks on source code structural information and (ii) what transformations to perform when and where in the source code.

Ransomware typically involves a 3-step process: analyzing the victim’s network traffic, identifying a vulnerability, and then exploiting it. Thus, the detection of ransomware has become an important undertaking that involves various sophisticated solutions for improving security. To further enhance ransomware detection capabilities, this paper focuses on an Application Programming Interface (API)-based ransomware detection approach in combination with machine learning (ML) techniques. The focus of this research is (i) understanding the life cycle of ransomware on the Windows platform, (ii) dynamic analysis of ransomware samples to extract various features of malicious code patterns, and (iii) developing and validating machine learning-based ransomware detection models on different ransomware and benign samples. Data were collected from publicly available repositories and subjected to sandbox analysis for sampling. The sampled datasets were applied to build machine learning models. The grid search hyperparameter optimization algorithm was employed to obtain the best fit model; the results were cross-validated with the testing datasets. This analysis yielded a high ransomware detection accuracy of 99.18% for Windows-based platforms and shows the potential for achieving high-accuracy ransomware detection capabilities when using a combination of API calls and an ML model.

Over the past years, a number of dynamic analysis techniques have been proposed to detect obfuscated malicious JavaScript code at runtime. However, because of their runtime overheads, these techniques are slow and thus not widely used in practice. On the other hand, since a large quantity of benign JavaScript code is obfuscated to protect intellectual property, it is not effective to use the intrinsic features of obfuscated JavaScript code for static analysis purposes. Therefore, we are forced to distinguish between obfuscated and non-obfuscated JavaScript code so that we can devise an efficient and effective analysis technique to detect malicious JavaScript code. In this paper, we address this issue by presenting JSObfusDetector, a novel one-class classifier ensemble to detect obfuscated JavaScript code. To construct the classifier ensemble, we apply a binary particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, called ParticlePruner, on an initial ensemble of one-class SVM classifiers to find a sub-ensemble whose members are both accurate and have diversity in their outputs.

Prevention of piracy and digital rights management has become very important. Information security is mandatory rather than an additional feature. Numerous software techniques have been proposed to provide certain level of copyright and intellectual property protection. Techniques like obfuscation attempts to transform the code into a form that is harder to reverse engineer. Tamper-proofing causes a program to malfunction when it detects that it has been modified. Software watermarking embeds copyright notice in the software code to allow the owners of the software to assert their intellectual property rights. The software techniques discourage software theft, can trace piracy, prove ownership, but cannot prevent copying itself. Thus, software based security firewalls and encryption is not completely safe from determined hackers. This necessitates the need for information security at the hardware level, where secure processors assume importance. In this talk the SCAN-Secure Processor is presented as a possible solution to these important issues mentioned above. The SCAN-SP is a modified Sparc V8 processor architecture with a new instruction set to handle image compression, encryption, information hiding and biometric authentication. A SCAN based methodology for encryption and decryption of 32 bit instructions and data and a Local-Global graph based methodology for biometric authentication is presented. The modules to support the new instructions are synthesized in reconfigurable logic and the results of FPGA synthesis are presented.

In general, the DM process involves creating a digital object (as CAD files) before using a slicer program to convert the models into printing instructions (e.g., g-code) suitable for the target printer. As the g-code is an intermediate machine format, malicious edits may be difficult to detect, especially when the golden (original) models are not available to the manufacturer.

The standard way to exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability involves a request that is too large for the buffer intended to hold it. The buffer overflow error causes the program to write part of the request beyond the bounds of the buffer, corrupting the address space of the program and causing the program to execute injected code contained in the request. We have implemented a compiler that inserts dynamic checks into the generated code to detect all out of bounds memory accesses. When it detects an out of bounds write, it stores the value away in a hash table to return as the value for corresponding out of bounds reads. The net effect is to (conceptually) give each allocated memory block unbounded size and to eliminate out of bounds accesses as a programming error. We have acquired several widely used open source servers (Apache, Sendmail, Pine, Mutt, and Midnight Commander). With standard compilers, all of these servers are vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks as documented at security tracking Web sites.

Searching binary code is particularly challenging due to large variations of compiler tool-chains and options and CPU architectures, as well as thousands of binary codes. Furthermore, there are some pivotal issues in current binary code search schemes, including inaccurate text-based or token-based analysis, slow graph matching, or complex deep learning processes. In this paper, we present an unsupervised tensor embedding scheme, Codee, to carry out code search efficiently and accurately at the binary function level. First, we use an NLP-based neural network to generate the semantic-aware token embedding. Second, we propose an efficient basic block embedding generation algorithm based on the network representation learning model. We learn both the semantic information of instructions and the control flow structural information to generate the basic block embedding. Then we use all basic block embeddings in a function to obtain a variable-length function feature vector. Third, we build a tensor to generate function embeddings based on the tensor singular value decomposition, which compresses the variable-length vectors into short fixed-length vectors to facilitate efficient search afterward. We further propose a dynamic tensor compression algorithm to incrementally update the function embedding database. Finally, we use the local sensitive hash method to find the top-$K$K similar matching functions in the repository. Compared with state-of-the-art cross-optimization-level code search schemes, such as Asm2Vec and DeepBinDiff, our scheme achieves higher average search accuracy, shorter feature vectors, and faster feature generation performance using four datasets, OpenSSL, Coreutils, libgmp and libcurl.

Consequently, the API selection has always been time-consuming and error-prone. In recent years, API recommendation systems have been introduced to help developers choose an API automatically, e.g., Eclipse and IntelliJ can generate an internal or user-defined API on the fly. Other research leveraged language models to capture the regularity in API usage and further guide the completion of APIs. While existing approaches provided a general support for API usage, they suffer from the lack of semantic awareness (e.g., Eclipse) and code relevance (e.g., language model based methods). To overcome these limitations, we proposed Crmac in this paper. The key insight of Crmac is a combination of a cache language model which learns code regularity from both open-source projects and local projects, as well as a relevance mining engine that identifies similar code to enable a weighted language model training.

Despite much effort, existing approaches target on matching the binary code and source code written in a single programming language. However, in practice, software applications are often written in different programming languages to cater for different requirements and computing platforms. Matching binary and source code across programming languages introduces additional challenges when maintaining multi-language and multi-platform applications.

To ensure that the software is secure, organizations must test it before purchase or deployment and identify any flaws that may expose the organizations to vulnerabilities. Binary code analysis is a new method for application security testing and is transforming software security. Binary analysis aids in many important applications including automatically fixing vulnerable software and malware detection. Plenty of research has been done to improve binary analysis using datasets related to different computer platforms, new compilers, and new optimization techniques. However, there is a vast majority of Android users and since it is an open-source platform it is equally vulnerable to similar attacks as well. In this research, we propose to implement deep neural networks to solve an essential yet difficult problem in binary analysis. We solve the problem of function boundary identification, a pivotal first step in a lot of binary analysis techniques. Neural networks have experienced a renewal in the past few years, achieving breakthrough outcomes in various fields such as object detection, language translation, and speech recognition. Yet no specific research has explored their utility in Android binary analysis. We exhibit that convolutional neural networks can identify functions in binaries with greater accuracy than the current state-of-the-art methods. Our model will be trained on a dataset of bytecode extracted from Android binaries.

Traditional defect prediction methods mainly focus on design static code metrics, and building machine learning classifiers to predict pieces of code that potentially defective. However, these manual extracted features do not contain syntactic and semantic information of programs. These information is much more important than those metrics and can improve the accuracy of defect prediction. In this paper, we propose a framework called software defect prediction via transformer (DP-Transformer) which capture syntactic and semantic features from programs and use them to improve defect prediction. Specifically, we first parse source code into ASTs and then select representative nodes from ASTs to form token vectors. Then we employ mapping and word embedding to convert token vectors into numerical vectors and send the numerical vectors to transformer. Transformer will automatically extract syntactic and semantic features and eventually feed these features into a Logistic Regression classifier. We evaluate our method on seven open-source Java projects with certain labels and take F-measure as evaluation criteria.

Over the past few years powerful security features have been added to mobile platforms. However, for legal and organisational reasons it is difficult to pervasively enforce using these features in consumer applications or Bring-Your-Own-Device (BYOD) scenarios. Thus application developers need to integrate custom implementations of security features such as encryption in security-critical applications. Our manual analysis of container applications and password managers has shown that custom implementations of cryptographic functionality often suffer from critical mistakes. During manual analysis, finding the custom cryptographic code was especially time consuming. Therefore, we present the Semdroid framework for simplifying application analysis of Android applications. Here, we use Semdroid to apply machine-learning techniques for detecting non-standard symmetric and asymmetric cryptography implementations.

It uses structured trees to replace simple word sequences so that the model can better learn the syntactic and semantic information in the source information. Therefore, it can alleviate the long dependency problem caused by too long source information. At the same time, the enhanced attention mechanism is adopted in the decoder to distinguish the influence of different historical actions on the current predicted action.

While the automated summarization of shellcode can help users unfamiliar with shellcode and network information security understand the intent of shellcode attacks. In this study, we propose a novel approach DualSC to solve the automatic shellcode generation and summarization tasks.

It is self-executable, self-verifiable, and embedded into the BC that eliminates the need for trusted third-party systems, which ultimately saves administration as well as service costs.

This information is often used for debugging, operational profiling, finding anomalies, detecting security threats, measuring performance etc. The log files are usually too big for extracting this valuable information manually, even though manual perusal is still one of the more widely used techniques. Recently a variety of data mining and machine learning algorithms are being used to analyze the information in the log files. A major road block for the efficient use of these algorithms is the inherent variability present in every log line of a log file. Each log line is a combination of a static message type field and a variable parameter field. Even though both these fields are required, the analyses algorithm often requires that these be separated out, in order to find correlations in the repeating log event types. This disentangling of the message and parameter fields to find the event types is called abstraction of log lines. Each log line is abstracted to a unique ID or event type and the dynamic parameter value is extracted to give an insight on the current state of the system. In this paper we present a technique based on a clustering technique used in the Simple Log file Clustering Tool for log file abstraction. This solution is especially useful when we don't have access to the source code of the application or when the lines in the log file do not conform to a rigid structure.

In VCSs, source code which can potentially be vulnerable is introduced to a system through what are so called commits. Vulnerable commits force the system into an insecure state. The farreaching impact of vulnerabilities attests to the importance of identifying and understanding the characteristics of prior vulnerable changes (or commits), in order to detect future similar ones. The concept of change classification was previously studied in the literature of bug detection to identify commits with defects.

Hardening DNNs against Transfer Attacks during Network Compression using Greedy Adversarial Pruning,J. O. Weiss; T. Alves; S.

These techniques accelerate model inference, reduce power consumption, and reduce the size and complexity of the hardware necessary to run DNNs, all with little to no loss in accuracy. However, since DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial inputs, it is important to consider the relationship between compression and adversarial robustness. In this work, we investigate the adversarial robustness of models produced by several irregular pruning schemes and by 8-bit quantization. Additionally, while conventional pruning removes the least important parameters in a DNN, we investigate the effect of an unconventional pruning method: removing the most important model parameters based on the gradient on adversarial inputs.

Information security: The SCAN — Secure processor with crypto-biometrics capabilities,N. Bourbakis,"Wright State University, USA",2010 International Conference on Data Communication Networking (DCNET),5 Apr 2011,2010.0,,,IS-11,IS-11,"Secure computing is gaining importance in recent times as computing capability is increasingly becoming distributed and information is everywhere. Prevention of piracy and digital rights management has become very important. Information security is mandatory rather than an additional feature. Numerous software techniques have been proposed to provide certain level of copyright and intellectual property protection. Techniques like obfuscation attempts to transform the code into a form that is harder to reverse engineer. Tamper-proofing causes a program to malfunction when it detects that it has been modified. Software watermarking embeds copyright notice in the software code to allow the owners of the software to assert their intellectual property rights. The software techniques discourage software theft, can trace piracy, prove ownership, but cannot prevent copying itself. Thus, software based security firewalls and encryption is not completely safe from determined hackers. This necessitates the need for information security at the hardware level, where secure processors assume importance. In this talk the SCAN-Secure Processor is presented as a possible solution to these important issues mentioned above. The SCAN-SP is a modified Sparc V8 processor architecture with a new instruction set to handle image compression, encryption, information hiding and biometric authentication. A SCAN based methodology for encryption and decryption of 32 bit instructions and data and a Local-Global graph based methodology for biometric authentication is presented. The modules to support the new instructions are synthesized in reconfigurable logic and the results of FPGA synthesis are presented.

These fields put forward higher security requirements to Python ecosystems. However, existing studies on machine learning systems in Python concentrate on data security, model security and model privacy, and just assume the underlying Python virtual machines (PVMs) are secure and trustworthy. Unfortunately, whether such an assumption really holds is still unknown.This paper presents, to the best of our knowledge, the first and most comprehensive empirical study on the security of CPython, the official and most deployed Python virtual machine. To this end, we first designed and implemented a software prototype dubbed PVMSCAN, then use it to scan the source code of the latest CPython (version 3.10) and other 10 versions (3.0 to 3.9), which consists of 3,838,606 lines of source code. Empirical results give relevant findings and insights towards the security of Python virtual machines, such as: 1) CPython virtual machines are still vulnerable, for example, PVMSCAN detected 239 vulnerabilities in version 3.10, including 55 null dereferences, 86 uninitialized variables and 98 dead stores; Python/C API-related vulnerabilities are very common and have become one of the most severe threats to the security of PVMs: for example, 70 Python/C API-related vulnerabilities are identified in CPython 3.10; 3) the overall quality of the code remained stable during the evolution of Python VMs with vulnerabilities per thousand line (VPTL) to be 0.50; and 4) automatic vulnerability rectification is effective: 166 out of 239 (69.46%) vulnerabilities can be rectified by a simple yet effective syntax-directed heuristics.We have reported our empirical results to the developers of CPython, and they have acknowledged us and already confirmed and fixed 2 bugs (as of this writing) while others are still being analyzed.

Although powerful, training such models on large code corpus can be tedious, time consuming and sensitive to code patterns (and practices) encountered during training. Consequently, these models are often trained on a small corpus and thus only estimate the language naturalness relative to a specific style of programming or type of project. To overcome these issues, we investigate the use of pre-trained generative language models to infer code naturalness. Pre-trained models are often built on big data, are easy to use in an out-of-the-box way and include powerful learning associations mechanisms. Our key idea is to quantify code naturalness through its predictability, by using state-of-the-art generative pre-trained language models. Thus, we suggest to infer naturalness by masking (omitting) code tokens, one at a time, of code-sequences, and checking the models’ ability to predict them. We explore three different predictability metrics; a) measuring the number of exact matches of the predictions, b) computing the embedding similarity between the original and predicted code, i.e., similarity at the vector space, and c) computing the confidence of the model when doing the token completion task regardless of the outcome. We implement this workflow, named CODEBERT-NT, and evaluate its capability to prioritize buggy lines over non-buggy ones when ranking code based on its naturalness. Our results, on 2,510 buggy versions of 40 projects from the SmartShark dataset, show that CODEBERTNT outperforms both, random-uniform and complexity-based ranking techniques, and yields comparable results to the n-gram models.",2693-9177,978-1-6654-7704-8,10.1109/QRS57517.2022.00098,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10062375,Code Naturalness;CodeBERT;Pre-trained models,Training;Measurement;Codes;Computational modeling;Software quality;Predictive models;Transformers,Big Data;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;program debugging;program diagnostics;public domain software;software engineering;software prototyping,code corpus;code naturalness;code patterns;code snippets;code-sequences;language naturalness;masking code tokens;n-gram models;original predicted code;pre-trained generative language models;ranking code;recent software-engineering research;state-of-the-art generative pre-trained language models;statistical language models,,2.0,,32.0,IEEE,20 Mar 2023,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,False,True,True,

At the same time, such global reuse also introduces new challenges to the software engineering community, with not only components but also their problems and vulnerabilities being now shared. For example, vulnerabilities found in APIs no longer affect only individual projects but instead might spread across projects and even global software ecosystem borders. Tracing these vulnerabilities at a global scale becomes an inherently difficult task since many of the existing resources required for such analysis still rely on proprietary knowledge representation. In this research, we introduce an ontology-based knowledge modeling approach that can eliminate such information silos. More specifically, we focus on linking security knowledge with other software knowledge to improve traceability and trust in software products (APIs).

To improve the robustness of neural networks against adversarial attacks, substantial research on adversarial defenses is being carried out, of which input transformation is a typical category of defenses. However, because the transformation also has an impact on the accuracy of clean examples, the existing transformation-based defenses usually adopt minor transformations such as shift and scaling, which limits the defense effect of the transformation to some extent. To this end, we propose a method by using dynamic and diverse transformations for defending against adversarial attacks. Firstly, we constructed a transformation pool that contains both minor and major transformations (e.g., flip, rotate). Secondly, we retrained the model with the data transformed by major transformations to ensure that the performance of model itself is not affected. Finally, we dynamically select transformations to preprocess the input of the model to defend against adversarial examples. We conducted extensive experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets and compared our method with the state-of-the-art adversarial training and transformation-based defenses.

Despite their abilities, these detectors have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial malware variants - meticulously modified, functionality-preserving versions of original malware executables generated by machine learning. Due to the nature of these adversarial modifications, these adversarial methods often use a single view of malware executables (i.e., the binary/hexadecimal view) to generate adversarial malware variants. This provides an opportunity for the defenders (i.e., malware detectors) to detect the adversarial variants by utilizing more than one view of a malware file (e.g., source code view in addition to the binary view). The rationale behind this idea is that while the adversary focuses on the binary view, certain characteristics of the malware file in the source code view remain untouched which leads to the detection of the adversarial malware variants. To capitalize on this opportunity, we propose Adversarially Robust Multiview Malware Defense (ARMD), a novel multi-view learning framework to improve the robustness of DL-based malware detectors against adversarial variants.

However, the early studies only focus on the accuracy of capturing text features or the efficiency of calculating relevance scores, which do not consider the semantic gap between bug reports in natural language and codes in programming language. In this paper, we propose a novel adversarial learning model to bridge the semantic gap. Due to the different characteristics of natural language and programming language, we propose two different representation models for bug reports and code files respectively, and regards the two representation models as the generators. Then we construct adversarial learning by adding a discriminator to distinguish the source of representations so that the model can learn the public features of different texts. In addition, method name is the summary of the code function, and the relevant method name often appears in the bug report. We consider the method name information according to whether the method name appears in the report. Our model can dynamically integrate the information to improve the model effect.

Prior attempts to automate attack attribution apply various machine learning techniques on features extracted from the malware's code and behavior in order to identify other similar malware whose authors are known. However, the same malware can be reused by multiple actors, and the actor who performed an attack using a malware might differ from the malware's author. Moreover, information collected during an incident may contain many clues about the identity of the attacker in addition to the malware used. In this paper, we propose a method of attack attribution based on textual analysis of threat intelligence reports, using state of the art algorithms and models from the fields of machine learning and natural language processing (NLP).

Among various code refactoring activities, method renaming often happens within the whole project evolution process. To perform method renaming, developers should first identify the exact methods that should be renamed, which is generally tedious and error-prone through manual analysis. Towards this end, researchers have proposed some approaches to automatically recommend candidate methods for renaming. To further improve the performance of existing techniques, in this paper, we propose a novel approach that fully leverages historical code changes and overlapping relationships among code entities to identify renaming opportunities for methods. Specifically, we first embed methods into vectors and incorporate overlapping relationships among code entities by using different attention heads in a deep learning network. Then, we apply these obtained vectors to train a classifier to predict potential renaming opportunities for methods. Finally, we utilize historical renaming activities of related code entities to further refine the predicted results.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach for automatic patch detection. we build a patch detector by learning the feature representation from the patched code in the binary format. We utilize the feature encoding technique to make the binary code trainable, and build our neural network model to learn the patch feature for increasing detection accuracy.

Somewhat surprisingly, the vast majority of work on side-channel analysis has been restricted to the “use case” of attacking cryptographic implementations through the recovery of keys. In this contribution, we show how side-channel analysis can be used for extracting code from embedded systems based on a CPU's electromagnetic emanation. There are many applications within and outside the security community where this is desirable. In cryptography, it can, e.g., be used for recovering proprietary ciphers and security protocols. Another broad application field is general security and reverse engineering, e.g., for detecting IP violations of firmware or for debugging embedded systems when there is no debug interface or it is proprietary. A core feature of our approach is that we take localized electromagnetic measurements that are spatially distributed over the IC being analyzed. Given these multiple inputs, we model code extraction as a classification problem that we solve with supervised learning algorithms. We apply a variant of linear discriminant analysis to distinguish between the multiple classes. In contrast to previous approaches, which reported instruction recognition rates between 40-70%, our approach detects more than 95% of all instructions for test code, and close to 90% for real-world code. The methods are thus very relevant for use in practice. Our method performs dynamic code recognition, which has both advantages (only the program parts that are actually executed are observed) but also limitations (rare code executions are difficult to observe).",1558-1101,978-3-9815-3705-5,10.7873/DATE.2015.0639,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7092372,,Clocks;Security;Feature extraction;Position measurement;Algorithm design and analysis;Reverse engineering;Probes,cryptographic protocols;firmware;learning (artificial intelligence);program debugging;reverse engineering,SCANDALee;side-channel-based disassembler;local electromagnetic emanations;side-channel analysis;cryptography;proprietary ciphers;security protocols;general security;reverse engineering;firmware IP violation detection;embedded system debugging;localized electromagnetic measurements;classification problem;supervised learning algorithm;linear discriminant analysis;dynamic code recognition,,17.0,,11.0,,23 Apr 2015,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,False,True,True,

However, its security issues cannot be ignored. In order to use cloud services, users must store programs, data, etc. in the cloud. Once the attacker gains control of the server, or the cloud service provider itself is not trustworthy, the user's programs and data face great risks. For the security of cloud computing, SGX (Intel Software Guard Extensions) technology proposed by Intel provides users with a hardware-assisted trusted execution environment, and isolates the program code and data that need to be protected in a container called Enclave to ensure its confidentiality and completeness. However, SGX sacrifices some performance, and applications running in SGX cannot get satisfactory speed. Therefore, in order to improve the availability of the SGX application, it is necessary to optimize the SGX operating mechanism and program logic to increase the speed of the program. This article designs a set of high-performance cloud computing systems, selects a deep learning framework as a case, combines the characteristics of the framework and the SGX operating mechanism, analyzes various factors affecting performance, proposes an optimization scheme, and implements the system.

Using low-power transceivers in NoC switches, novel WiNoC architectures have been shown to achieve higher energy efficiency with improved peak bandwidth and reduced on-chip data transfer latency. However, using wireless interconnects for intrachip data transfer over an unguided medium introduces additional security vulnerabilities in on-chip communication arising from either external attackers or internal hardware Trojans. In this article, we propose a mechanism to make the wireless communication in a WiNoC secure against persistent jamming-based denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and eavesdropping (ED) from both external and internal attackers. Persistent jamming attacks on the on-chip wireless medium will cause interference in data transfer over the duration of the attack resulting in errors in contiguous bits, known as burst errors. Therefore, we use a burst-error correction code to monitor the rate of burst errors received over the wireless medium and deploy a machine-learning (ML) classifier to detect the persistent jamming attack and distinguish it from random burst errors. In the event of a persistent jamming attack, alternate routing strategies are proposed to avoid the DoS attack over the wireless medium, so that a secure data transfer can be sustained even in the presence of persistent jamming. In the event of an external ED attack, we deploy a low-latency and lightweight data scrambling method to secure communication over the wireless channel. In the case of an internal ED, we propose a mechanism to identify the attacker and prevent the attack. We evaluate the proposed techniques on a WiNoC in the presence of DoS and ED attacks from both internal and external attackers. On an average, 99.87% of the attack on DoS detection was achieved with the chosen ML classifier. A bandwidth degradation of <; 3% is experienced in the event of both DoS and ED internal attacks. The wireless interconnects are disabled in the presence of a persistent external jamming DoS attack for security, therefore eliminating the advantages of the wireless interconnections making the performance of the WiNoC comparable with that of a wired NoC. Although scrambling overheads are incurred in the presence of an external ED attack, the overheads are minimized by adopting simple XOR-based encoding and decoding.",1557-9999,,10.1109/TVLSI.2019.2928960,National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CNS-1553264);,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8812710,Denial-of-service (DoS);eavesdropping (ED);jamming;machine learning (ML);network-on-chip (NoC);on-chip security;wireless interconnect,Wireless communication;Communication system security;Jamming;Wireless sensor networks;Security;System-on-chip;Computer architecture,circuit analysis computing;energy conservation;error correction codes;invasive software;jamming;learning (artificial intelligence);low-power electronics;network-on-chip;pattern classification;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security,internal attackers;on-chip wireless medium;burst-error correction code;random burst errors;secure data transfer;wireless channel;external attackers;wireless interconnects;persistent external jamming DoS attack;wireless interconnections;eavesdropping attacks;nonscalable multihop data transmission paths;traditional wired NoC architectures;on-chip data transfer;intrachip data transfer;on-chip communication;wireless communication;WiNoC secure;persistent jamming-based denial-of-service attacks;wireless network-on-chips;low-power transceivers;NoC switches;security vulnerabilities;internal hardware Trojans;machine-learning classifier;lightweight data scrambling method;low-latency data scrambling method;DoS detection;ML classifier;bandwidth degradation;scrambling overheads;XOR-based encoding;XOR-based decoding;energy efficiency;alternate routing strategies;ED attacks,,21.0,,28.0,IEEE,26 Aug 2019,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals,False,True,True,

This concern is evidenced by the increased use of compromised IoT devices in large scale bot networks (botnets) to launch distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks against high value targets. Unsecured IoT systems can also provide entry points to private networks, allowing adversaries relatively easy access to valuable resources and services. Indeed, these evolving IoT threat vectors (ranging from brute force attacks to remote code execution exploits) are posing key challenges. Moreover, many traditional security mechanisms are not amenable for deployment on smaller resource-constrained IoT platforms. As a result, researchers have been developing a range of methods for IoT security, with many strategies using advanced machine learning (ML) techniques.

Prior hidden information detection schemes have their roots in either heuristic-based or Machine Learning (ML). However, prior heuristics-based schemes lack a rigorous theoretical analysis. Prior ML-based information schemes lack robustness because a printed 2D barcode is very much environmentally dependent. Thus, an information hiding detection scheme trained in one environment often does not work well in another environment. In this paper, we propose two hidden information detection schemes for existing anti-copying 2D barcodes. The first scheme directly uses the pixel distance to detect the use of an information hiding scheme in a 2D barcode, referred to as the Pixel Distance Based Detection (PDBD) scheme. The second scheme first calculates the variance of raw signal and the covariance between the recovered and raw signals, and then based on the variance results, detects the use of information hiding scheme in a 2D barcode, referred to as the Pixel Variance Based Detection (PVBD) scheme. Moreover, we design advanced Illegitimately-Copying (IC) attacks to evaluate the security of two existing anti-copying 2D barcodes. We conduct extensive performance comparisons among the proposed schemes and prior schemes under different capturing devices, e.g., different scanners or camera phones. Our experimental results show that the PVBD scheme can correctly detect the existence of hidden information at both the 2LQR code and the LCAC 2D barcode.

It is often hard to prepare a runnable environment for dynamic analysis of these document files because they exploit specific vulnerabilities. In these cases, it is necessary to identify the position of the shellcode in each document file to analyze it. If the exploit code uses executable scripts such as JavaScript and Flash, it is not so hard to locate the shellcode. On the other hand, it is sometimes almost impossible to locate the shellcode when it does not contain any JavaScript or Flash but consists of native x86 code only. Binary fragment classification is often applied to visualize the location of regions of interest, and shellcode must contain at least a small fragment of x86 native code even if most of it is obfuscated, such as a decoder for the obfuscated body of the shellcode. In this paper, we propose a novel method, o-glasses, to visualize the shellcode by recognizing the x86 native code using a specially designed one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1d-CNN). The fragment size needs to be as small as the minimum size of the x86 native code in the whole shellcode.

This has led to the development of many image encryption algorithms, such as perceptual/selective encryption methods which represent an effective way for the security and confidentiality of images. However, few studies focus on visual security metric, which is very important tool for evaluating the effectiveness of these encryption methods. Most of the adopted metrics are the classical randomness-based measures or the objective image quality assessment metrics. However, these metrics showed their limits as a visual security metric, because they do not deal with the content intelligibility, which is one of the key security requirements. Consequently, in this paper, we propose a no-reference (NR) visual security metric for perceptually encrypted images based on multi-output learning called VSMML. The proposed metric consists of a convolutional neural network (CNN) taking as input an encrypted image and providing two outputs corresponding to the visual security (VS) and visual quality (VQ) scores. Experiments were performed on two publicly perceptually encrypted image databases and the results show that the proposed metric significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for visual security and quality assessment tasks.

Existing works mostly leverage the popular CNN classification backbones in computer vision to achieve histopathological tissue classification. In this paper, we propose a super lightweight plug-and-play module, named Pyramidal Deep-Broad Learning (PDBL), for any well-trained classification backbone to improve the classification performance without a re-training burden. For each patch, we construct a multi-resolution image pyramid to obtain the pyramidal contextual information. For each level in the pyramid, we extract the multi-scale deep-broad features by our proposed Deep-Broad block (DB-block). We equip PDBL in three popular classification backbones, ShuffLeNetV2, EfficientNetb0, and ResNet50 to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed module on two datasets (Kather Multiclass Dataset and the LC25000 Dataset).

Malware poses a major threat for computer security and information security in general. Over the years, malware has evolved to the point that a single malware specimen can have hundreds or maybe thousands of variants using polymorphic and metamorphic transformation to change the signature of the malware variant in propagation. The common signature-based malware detection methods are no longer robust to detect these variants due to the alteration of code. Static analysis is required to obtain these signatures and anti-virus companies are required to propagate these signature updates to their software. A faster detection method is needed to compensate the exponentially increasing number of malware variants. Machine learning is a trending approach for malware detection. This removes the need to use signature-based detection and is also faster. Software companies do not need to propagate signatures as often. Machine learning algorithms using opcode sequences can recognise patterns in the malicious code that are not present in common signatures and classify them more efficiently. Therefore, a machine learning approach for malware detection should be adopted for faster and more efficient detection. Most research in malware detection using machine learning used static attributes such as network connections, processes spawned, hashes, etc., that were not that robust to changes. In this paper we introduced our novel approach in using trigrams and PE file attributes as features for malware detection. We took a text mining approach to make our detection method more robust to polymorphism and metamorphism. The instruction sequence for critical code in malware on the assembly level is basically the same across malware families. We used opcode trigram sequences as the main feature for our machine learning algorithm. We used Support Vector Machine(SVM) as our classifying algorithm which is a discriminative classifier model that gives a definite decision whether the predicted outcome belongs to the learned class or not.

As malware become more capable at hiding its malicious intent through the use of code obfuscation, it becomes imperative for malware detection techniques to keep up with the pace of malware changes. Currently, most of the existing malware detection approaches for Android platform use semantic pattern matching, which is highly effective but is limited to what the computers have encountered before.

Most of information theft apps rely on network interfaces to steal users' privacy and use short message service (SMS) to implement command and control. In this paper, we propose an available and effective user-role identification model, MURITE-detector (Mobile User-Role in Information Theft Events detector), by using network flows and call detail records (CDRs) with convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm. Firstly, we generate network flow vectors and CDR vectors from raw data sets, and then match them into node vectors. Subsequently, we use CNN to classify user-roles into: Sourcer, Transferer, Victim and Other. Because of command-and-control server invalidation and system version incompatibility, etc., most of the collected information theft apps can't run properly in reality. So we extract code modules from some of these apps, and then recode and compile them into ITM-capsule (Information Theft Modules capsule) to generate information theft network traffic. Finally, we obtain 37,384 information theft network flows, 61,635 benign network flows and 200,522 short message CDRs. We match these data through labels and construct two node vector sets A and B randomly. In addition, we also compare CNN with other machine learning algorithms, and the result shows that CNN performs better.

Recent work tried to bridge this gap either by fine-tuning or re-training the network at different resolutions. However retraining a network is rarely cheap and not always viable. To this end, we propose a simple solution to address the train-test distributional shift and enhance the performance of pretrained models - which commonly ship as a package with deep learning platforms e.g., PyTorch. Specifically, we demonstrate that running inference on the center crop of an image is not always the best as important discriminatory information may be cropped-off. Instead we propose to combine results for multiple random crops for a test image. This not only matches the train time augmentation but also provides the full coverage of the input image. We explore combining representation of random crops through averaging at different levels i.e., deep feature level, logit level, and softmax level. We demonstrate that, for various families of modern deep networks, such averaging results in better validation accuracy compared to using a single central crop per image. The softmax averaging results in the best performance for various pre-trained networks without requiring any re-training or fine-tuning whatsoever. On modern GPUs with batch processing, the paper's approach to inference of pre-trained networks, is essentially free as all images in a batch can all be processed at once.

This is one of the reasons that make the development of complementary protection techniques, like the one proposed in this work, necessary. In the first part of the paper, the spoofing SCER attacks are analyzed in detail for GPS and, particularly, for Galileo. The role of the Galileo Pseudorandom Noise (PRN) intra-satellite non-orthogonality distortion term in hindering the attacks is discussed and a detailed comparison between GPS and Galileo expected quality curves for the SCER attack is provided.

Information security: The SCAN — Secure processor with crypto-biometrics capabilities,N. Bourbakis,"Wright State University, USA",2010 International Conference on Wireless Information Networks and Systems (WINSYS),5 Apr 2011,2010.0,,,IS-11,IS-11,"Summary form only given. Secure computing is gaining importance in recent times as computing capability is increasingly becoming distributed and information is everywhere. Prevention of piracy and digital rights management has become very important. Information security is mandatory rather than an additional feature. Numerous software techniques have been proposed to provide certain level of copyright and intellectual property protection. Techniques like obfuscation attempts to transform the code into a form that is harder to reverse engineer. Tamper-proofing causes a program to malfunction when it detects that it has been modified. Software watermarking embeds copyright notice in the software code to allow the owners of the software to assert their intellectual property rights. The software techniques discourage software theft, can trace piracy, prove ownership, but cannot prevent copying itself. Thus, software based security firewalls and encryption is not completely safe from determined hackers. This necessitates the need for information security at the hardware level, where secure processors assume importance. In this talk the SCAN-Secure Processor is presented as a possible solution to these important issues mentioned above. The SCAN-SP is a modified Sparc V8 processor architecture with a new instruction set to handle image compression, encryption, information hiding and biometric authentication. A SCAN based methodology for encryption and decryption of 32 bit instructions and data and a Local-Global graph based methodology for biometric authentication is presented. The modules to support the new instructions are synthesized in reconfigurable logic and the results of FPGA synthesis are presented. The ultimate goal of the presented work is the tradeoffs that exists between speed of execution and security of the processor. Designing a faster processor is not the goal of the presented work, rather exploring the architecture to provide security is of prime importance.",,978-989-8425-24-9,,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5741468,,Awards activities;Software;Information security;Artificial intelligence;IEEE Computer Society;Conferences,biometrics (access control);cryptography;field programmable gate arrays;industrial property;microprocessor chips;watermarking,information security;crypto-biometrics capabilities;SCAN-secure processor;secure computing;piracy;digital rights management;intellectual property protection;software watermarking;Sparc V8 processor architecture;encryption;decryption;local-global graph based methodology;biometric authentication;FPGA synthesis;image compression;tamper-proofing,,,,,,5 Apr 2011,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,True,True,True,

The key idea is to conduct spatial aggregation on local human parts via global average-pooling to acquire the strong spatial misalignment tolerance, with VALD encoding on the local parts for facilitating discriminative power jointly. This proposition is built on NetVLAD to ensure end-to-end deep learning capacity. Due to the fine-grained property of person re-ID task that has not been well concerned by the original NetVLAD model for scene recognition, a feature refinement layer that consists of 1 fully-connected (FC) layer and 2 batch normalization (BN) layers is added on top of the raw NetVLAD layer to enhance the discriminative power and training convergence. And, a human body occlusion and background component dropout manner is also proposed to resist the effect of serious occlusion. Technically, a refined codeword initialization manner is proposed to alleviate the potential codeword imbalance problem caused by naive random initialization. The proposed discriminative spatial aggregation approach is then conducted on multi-resolution convolutional feature map layers hierarchically via early feature fusion, to involve richer semantic and fine-grained visual clues jointly. Wide-range experiments on 6 datasets (i.e., CUHK03, DukeMTMC-reID, Occluded-DukeMTMC, Market-1501, MSMT17 and Occluded-REID) verifies the effectiveness of our proposition.

However, CNF may introduce new security concerns (e.g., data exfiltration and ransomware) due to potential code injection attacks against network functions at runtime. This will potentially result in a breach of functional integrity of these network functions. Towards verifying such functional integrity breaches of CNFs at the 5G-operator-level, existing approaches fell short, as most of them either (i) perform pre-deployment verification (i.e., verifying the CNF image before the deployment) and hence fail to verify integrity breaches occurring after the deployment, or (ii) perform post-deployment verification (i.e., verifying against attack signatures or normal behavior patterns) approaches that require provider-level data (e.g., system calls) which is usually inaccessible to 5G operators. In this paper, we propose 5GFIVer, a new operator-oriented approach for functional integrity verification of CNFs that overcomes the above-mentioned limitations. First, our approach utilizes the side-channel information such as performance metrics (which are already available at the operator level) so that no provider-level data is needed. Second, our approach implements unsupervised machine learning algorithms to detect outliers through time-series analysis of those available performance metrics, and hence no instrumentation for the data collection as well as no training data is required. Third, we leverage the correlation between multiple CNFs to improve the accuracy and minimize false positives (e.g., caused by cloud dynamics).

However, Yara rules are generally written manually, and their quality is related to the level of analysts, which makes it difficult to guarantee the effectiveness of Yara detection. Some of the current work can automatically generate Yara rules, but most of the methods are blacklist matching in nature, which may cause a degradation of the detection effect when the database is small. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes the Bert-based strings language model (beslm), which can effectively learn the semantic information of Yara rules and the association relationship between strings through pre-training phase and finetuning phase, and can filter out high-quality strings and thus improve the detection effect. The experimental results demonstrate that the Yara rules automatically generated by beslm improve 13.3%, 13.8%, and 15.1% on average in three detection metrics compared with the comparison method.",,978-1-6654-8474-9,10.1109/AEMCSE55572.2022.00052,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9948221,Yara;Strings;BERT;Malware detection,Measurement;Degradation;Semantics;Manuals;Network security;Malware;Yarn,computer network security;data protection;information systems;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data;telecommunication security,Bert-based strings language model;detection effect;detection metrics;high-quality strings;information systems;information technology;information theft;malicious behaviors;malicious code;network security practitioners;semantic information;Yara detection;Yara rule enhancement;Yara rules,,,,16.0,IEEE,16 Nov 2022,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,False,True,True,

Yet, incorporating spatial information in the classification process can improve the classification accuracy even further. Existing convolutional neural network (CNN) usually only focuses on local features in hyperspectral cubes, whereas the burgeoning vision transformer (ViT) is interested in global features in HSIs. In this letter, we propose a deep aggregated framework for HSI classification called convolution transformer mixer (CTMixer) to combine the advantages of the above two paradigms effectively. A group parallel residual block is first applied to capture local spectral-spatial features in the HSI patches. Second, a double-branch structure, consisting of the CNN and transformer branches, is developed to capture local–global hyperspectral features. Finally, to achieve an elegant combination of CNN and ViT, a novel local–global multihead self-attention mechanism (MHSA) is proposed by introducing convolution operations in the MHSA to further improve the classification accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the CTMixer achieves competitive classification results on several common HSI datasets compared with other state-of-the-art networks.

Existing solutions either base static reasoning on syntactic properties, such as exception handlers or configuration fields, or compute data-flow reachability over the program, which leads to scalability challenges. We explore a new and complementary category of features, which strikes a middleground between the above two categories. This new category focuses on security-relevant operations (communcation, lifecycle, etc) --- and in particular, their multiplicity and happens-before order --- as a means to distinguish between malicious and benign applications. Computing these features requires semantic, yet lightweight, modeling of the program's behavior. We have created a malware detection system for Android, MassDroid, that collects traces of security-relevant operations from the call graph via a scalable form of data-flow analysis. These are reduced to happens-before and multiplicity features, then fed into a supervised learning engine to obtain a malicious/benign classification. MassDroid also embodies a novel reporting interface, containing pointers into the code that serve as evidence supporting the determination. We have applied MassDroid to 35,000 Android apps from the wild. The results are highly encouraging with an F-score of 95% in standard testing, and >90% when applied to previously unseen malware signatures.

Both are human-related. The former was traced to flaws caused by human interventions in development. In the latter case, humans also intervene to connect the dots, find meaningful patterns, and make sense of the information. The proposed solutions are based on more human interventions, which tend to aggravate the problems rather than solving them. I propose the complete elimination of human interventions in both cases. This goal is conceptually easy to achieve. The approach, however, is radical and theoretical. It considers the causal set, a mathematical object, as the universal language underlying all information in nature and, hence, also all computation. This assumption is recognized as the fundamental principle of causality, that effects follow their causes. The new theory is based solely on the causal set, its metric, and its vast array of algebraic properties. The consequences are unexpected, fascinating, and totally new. Since translations between causal sets and programming languages are easy, I also propose to confine the use of programming languages to the human interface, and create an inner layer of mathematical code expressed as a causal set.

To address this imminent issue, in this paper, we bring a significant insight to leverage both social coding properties and code content for automatic detection of insecure code snippets in Stack Overflow. To determine if the given code snippets are insecure, we not only analyze the code content, but also utilize various kinds of relations among users, badges, questions, answers and code snippets in Stack Overflow. To model the rich semantic relationships, we first introduce a structured heterogeneous information network (HIN) for representation and then use meta-path based approach to incorporate higher-level semantics to build up relatedness over code snippets. Later, we propose a novel hierarchical attention-based sequence learning model named CodeHin2Vec to seamlessly integrate node (i.e., code snippet) content with HIN-based relations for representation learning. After that, a classifier is built for insecure code snippet detection.

One typical application of DL in IoT is device identification from wireless signals, namely, noncryptographic device identification (NDI). However, learning components in NDI systems have to evolve to adapt to operational variations, such a paradigm is termed as incremental learning (IL). Various IL algorithms have been proposed and many of them require dedicated space to store the increasing amount of historical data, and therefore, they are not suitable for IoT or mobile applications. Besides, conventional IL schemes can not provide satisfying performance when historical data are not available. In this article, we address the IL problem in NDI from a new perspective, first, we provide a new metric to measure the degree of topological maturity of DNN models from the degree of conflict of class-specific fingerprints. We discover that an important cause for performance degradation in IL-enabled NDI is owing to the conflict of devices’ fingerprints. Second, we also show that the conventional IL schemes can lead to low topological maturity of DNN models in NDI systems. Thirdly, we propose a new channel separation-enabled IL (CSIL) scheme without using historical data, in which our strategy can automatically separate devices’ fingerprints in different learning stages and avoid potential conflict. Finally, We evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed framework using real data from automatic-dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B), an application of IoT in aviation.

The proposed approach offers abstraction and automation to the software engineering processes, as well as the Data Analytics (DA) and Machine Learning (ML) practices. This is realized in an integrated and seamless manner. We implement and validate the proposed approach by extending an open source modeling tool, called ThingML. ThingML is a domain-specific language and modeling tool with code generation for the IoT/CPS domain. Neither ThingML nor any other IoT/CPS modeling tool supports DA/ML at the modeling level. Therefore, as the primary contribution of the doctoral dissertation, we add the necessary syntax and semantics concerning DA/ML methods and techniques to the modeling language of ThingML. Moreover, we support the APIs of several ML libraries and frameworks for the automated generation of the source code of the target software in Python and Java.

However, many features generated by static analyses can be easily thwarted by obfuscation techniques. Therefore, several researchers have addressed this obfuscation problem with obfuscation-invariant features. However, to the best of our knowledge, no researcher has utilized deobfuscation techniques. To this end, we adopt a code deobfuscation technique with an Android malware detection system and investigate its effects. Experimental results indicate that code deobfuscation can successfully retrieve useful information concealed by obfuscation. Further, we propose interaction terms based on identified feature interactions. The proposed interaction terms aim to eliminate the interference caused by the size of the application and other features because many feature values are correlated to the size of the application. In addition, the experimental results indicate that these interaction terms have a high ranking in terms of feature importance values.

Using low-power transceivers in NoC switches, novel Wireless NoC (WiNoC) architectures have been shown to achieve higher energy efficiency with improved peak bandwidth and reduced on-chip data transfer latency. However, using wireless interconnects for data transfer within a chip makes the on-chip communications vulnerable to various security threats from either external attackers or internal hardware Trojans (HTs). In this work, we propose a mechanism to make the wireless communication in a WiNoC secure against persistent jamming based Denial-of-Service attacks from both external and internal attackers. Persistent jamming attacks on the on-chip wireless medium will cause interference in data transfer over the duration of the attack resulting in errors in contiguous bits, known as burst errors. Therefore, we use a burst error correction code to monitor the rate of burst errors received over the wireless medium and deploy a Machine Learning (ML) classifier to detect the persistent jamming attack and distinguish it from random burst errors. In the event of jamming attack, alternate routing strategies are proposed to avoid the DoS attack over the wireless medium, so that a secure data transfer can be sustained even in the presence of jamming. We evaluate the proposed technique on a secure WiNoC in the presence of DoS attacks. It has been observed that with the proposed defense mechanisms, WiNoC can outperform a wired NoC even in presence of attacks in terms of performance and security. On an average, 99.87% attack detection was achieved with the chosen ML Classifiers. A bandwidth degradation of <;3% is experienced in the event of internal attack, while the wireless interconnects are disabled in the presence of an external attacker.",2159-3477,978-1-7281-3391-1,10.1109/ISVLSI.2019.00065,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8839617,Network-on-chip;On chip interconnect;On chip security;Wireless NoC;DoS;Jamming attack;Machine learning;Hardware security,Wireless communication;Jamming;Wireless sensor networks;System-on-chip;Denial-of-service attack,error correction codes;jamming;learning (artificial intelligence);network-on-chip;radio networks;radio transceivers;radiofrequency interconnections;radiofrequency interference;switches;switching networks;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security,denial-of-service attacks;nonscalable multihop data transmission paths;low-power transceivers;NoC switches;on-chip data transfer;internal hardware Trojans;wireless communication;persistent jamming attack;on-chip wireless medium;DoS attack;network-on-chip communications;wireless NoC architectures;wireless interconnection;wired NoC architectures;random burst error correction code;data transfer security threats;WiNoC security;HT;ML classifiers;machine learning classifier,,7.0,,21.0,IEEE,19 Sep 2019,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,False,True,True,

To this end, Software Guard Extensions (SGX) is proposed to provide an isolated Trust Execution Environment (TEE) for security and privacy guarantee.

To this end, in this paper, we design Lasagna, as an SGX based secure DNN inference acceleration framework, which explores the layered-structure of DNN models to well balance the usage of the scarce EPC resources and the computation resources. Lasagna mainly consists of a global task balancer and a local task scheduler, responding for task dispatching across distributed edge servers and task scheduling in local server, respectively.

Mixed code is generated when users use more than a single language in social network comments. Such data presents a significant challenge for applications using sentiment analysis and is yet to be fully explored by researchers. Existing sentiment analysis methods applied to monolingual social data are not suitable for code-mixed data due to the inconsistency in the grammatical structure in these sentences.

Generally, a smart contract is a piece of executable code that automatically runs on the blockchain to enforce an agreement preset between parties involved in the transaction. As an innovative technology, smart contracts have been applied in various business areas, such as digital asset exchange, supply chains, crowdfunding, and intellectual property. Unfortunately, many security issues in smart contracts have been reported in the media, often leading to substantial financial losses. These security issues pose new challenges to security research because the execution environment of smart contracts is based on blockchain computing and its decentralized nature of execution. Thus far, many partial solutions have been proposed to address specific aspects of these security issues, and the trend is to develop new methods and tools to automatically detect common security vulnerabilities. However, smart contract security is systematic engineering that should be explored from a global perspective, and a comprehensive study of issues in smart contract security is urgently needed.

The mean throughput perceived by the user is one of the most important KPIs an operator has to monitor and this KPI depends on the total traffic carried by the network. So the operators should have a clear idea about the current mean user throughput that it can provide and the estimation of the mean user throughput in the coming months to plan the services and the offers that can be suggested to the clients. In this paper, we use a training data set that contains the daily evolution of the two KPIs (mean user throughput and total traffic carried over the network) for a mobile operator during one year and we implement the machine learning linear regression technique to prove that the mean user throughput can be estimated by a linear function of the total traffic carried over the network using gradient descent algorithm.

Modern operating systems rely on code signing, which uses a default-valid trust model, for executable files to identify their publishers. A malware could pass software validation of operating systems and security software by using counterfeit code-signing certificates. Although the counterfeit certificates can be revoked by CAs, the previous research showed that the revocation delay takes as long as 5.6 months. In this paper, we attempt to identify the credibility of software with multiple-version executable files without relying on public key infrastructure (PKI), where a new-version executable file is usually developed incrementally based on the previous versions. The sharing features among different versions can be extracted for identifying the software. Accordingly, we present a software-birthmark scheme to serve our purpose. Our scheme generates a cross-version software birthmark for executable files of the same software. The proposed software birthmark is a binary-classification model of a machine learning algorithm based on imported and exported function names extracted from different-version executable files. To evaluate the performance of version-wide software birthmarks, our experiments include 138 versions of Windows kernel32.dll and 545 versions of firefox.exe. We also use multiple machine learning algorithms for performance comparisons. The results show that proposed software birthmark can effectively identify the derivations of these executable files.

Antimalware software can help safeguard information systems and minimize their exposure to the malware. Most of anti-malware programs detect malware instances based on signature or pattern matching. Data mining and machine learning techniques can be used to automatically detect models and patterns behind different types of malware variants. However, traditional machine-based learning techniques such as SVM, decision trees and naive Bayes seem to be only suitable for detecting malicious code, not effective enough for complex problems such as classification. In this article, we propose a new prototype extraction method for non-traditional prototype-based machine learning classification. The prototypes are extracted using hypercuboids. Each hypercuboid covers all training data points of a malware family. Then we choose the data points nearest to the hyperplanes as the prototypes. Malware samples will be classified based on the distances to the prototypes.

Powerful computing resource provides more exhaustive protection for app markets than maintaining detection by a single user. However, apart from the applications (apps) provided by the official market (i.e., Google Play Store), apps from unofficial markets and third-party resources are always causing serious security threats to end-users. Meanwhile, it is a time-consuming task if the app is downloaded first and then uploaded to the server side for detection, because the network transmission has a lot of overhead. In addition, the uploading process also suffers from the security threats of attackers. Consequently, a last line of defense on mobile devices is necessary and much-needed.

Researchers have developed systems for automated patch generation to address this problem, which attempt to reduce the manual work required for diagnosing and addressing faulty code. Machine Learning models, which can leverage large amounts of information, for example, from large code repositories, promise one possible set of solutions for automated patch generation. In particular, researchers have recently used sequential generative adversarial networks (GANs) successfully in text-based prediction tasks. We thus propose a model for sequential generative adversarial networks for automated patch generation (SeqGAN-APG), which divides the task of patch generation into a two-part adversarial framework that learns the distribution of sequential features in non-buggy code while also learning to generate sequential features which mimic that distribution.

Among them, Ethereum smart contract is favored by developers for its “event-triggered” mechanism for building education intelligent trading systems and intelligent learning platforms. However, due to the immutability of blockchain, published smart contracts cannot be modified, so problematic contracts cannot be fixed by modifying the code in the educational blockchain. In recent years, security incidents due to smart contract vulnerabilities have caused huge property losses, so the detection of smart contract vulnerabilities in educational blockchain has become a great challenge. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a graph neural network (GNN) based vulnerability detection for smart contracts in educational blockchains. Firstly, the bytecodes are decompiled to get the opcode. Secondly, the basic blocks are divided, and the edges between the basic blocks according to the opcode execution logic are added. Then, the control flow graphs (CFG) are built. Finally, we designed a GNN-based model for vulnerability detection.

It facilitates sharing of data and services among applications using a rich inter-app communication system. While access to resources can be controlled by the Android permission system, enforcing permissions is not sufficient to prevent security violations, as permissions may be mismanaged, intentionally or unintentionally. Android’s enforcement of the permissions is at the level of individual apps, allowing multiple malicious apps to collude and combine their permissions or to trick vulnerable apps to perform actions on their behalf that are beyond their individual privileges. In this paper, we present  COVERT, a tool for compositional analysis of Android inter-app vulnerabilities. COVERT’s analysis is modular to enable incremental analysis of applications as they are installed, updated, and removed. It statically analyzes the reverse engineered source code of each individual app, and extracts relevant security specifications in a format suitable for formal verification. Given a collection of specifications extracted in this way, a formal analysis engine (e.g., model checker) is then used to verify whether it is safe for a combination of applications—holding certain permissions and potentially interacting with each other—to be installed together.

QR codes are used in several domains, particularly when there is a need to transfer various types of text information. A key aspect of this work is to thus propose a new methodology to overcome the weaknesses of the limited size of the traditional QR code, which has long been an important issue in a wide range of areas. The proposed algorithm incorporates a clear and simple plan for overcoming this difficulty by inserting confidential information into a QR code message. The QR code is updated through the addition of levels that help to share secure messages of various sizes and to authenticate documents for verification and validation. In this work, the newly proposed QR code does not reconstruct the configuration or structure of the QR code. Rather, it provides better security because it relies on the features of the Huffman compression algorithm to reduce the size of the input data and the principles of encryption through the XOR function, which is done through a variable encryption key.

Therefore, this article proposes a novel approach to embed hyperlinks into common images, making the hyperlinks invisible for human eyes but detectable for mobile devices equipped with a camera. Our approach is an end-to-end neural network with an encoder to hide messages and a decoder to extract messages. To maintain the hidden message resilient to cameras, we build a distortion network between the encoder and the decoder to augment the encoded images. The distortion network uses differentiable 3-D rendering operations, which can simulate the distortion introduced by camera imaging in both printing and display scenarios. To maintain the visual attraction of the image with hyperlinks, a loss function conforming to the human visual system (HVS) is used to supervise the training of the encoder. Experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms the previous work on both robustness and quality.

The DDoS attack tries to destroy the database by creating a flood of internet traffic at the targeted server end. Attackers send the spoofing applications to the vulnerable UDP Memcached server which even manipulate the legitimate identity of the sender. In this work, we have proposed a vector quantization approach based on a supervised deep learning approach to detect the Memcached attack performed by the use of malicious firmware on different types of Cloud attached devices. This vector quantization approach detects the DDoas attack performed by malicious firmware on the different types of cloud devices and this also classifies the applications which are vulnerable to attack based on cloud-The Hackbeased services.

Since these contracts are immutable, there is a serious requirement to audit and test these contracts multiple times before they are deployed. There are several cases of financial and reputation damage due to unaudited smart contracts as seen in the cases of the Axie Infinity hack or Wormhole bridge hack which resulted in hundreds of millions of dollar losses. For a developer just getting into web3 development, these hacks might intimidate and drive them away from learning due to the fear of incurring such losses themselves or due to not understanding the reason for hacks. This tool allows a developer to simply paste their contract into a textbox and obtain a list of the contract-based vulnerabilities found via parsing and pattern searching. Mitigation techniques are also suggested line by line to aid the developer in securing the contract. The key difference between this tool and existing technologies is that it is compact and very precise in identifying known contract-based vulnerabilities. Providing developers with a quick and simple interface was the rationale behind the motivation. Tools like parsers and regular expression libraries were used to look for keyword detection methodology. The tool is to be used supplementarily and not as the sole identifier of vulnerabilities since there are multiple layers to web3 security and this tool only identifies smart contract-based vulnerabilities, not off-chain ones. Future additions to this tool may include example vulnerable code snippets and also explanations for the reason they are not safe for deployment as well as mitigations which can be used by any user who is interested in learning web3 security and how hacks happen.",,979-8-3503-3384-8,10.1109/ICDSAAI55433.2022.10028877,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10028877,Ethereum smart contract language;Wormhole bridge hack;Axie Infinity hack;vulnerabilities,Bridges;Codes;Computer hacking;Smart contracts;Libraries;Blockchains;Security,blockchains;computer crime;contracts;Internet,Axie Infinity hack;blockchain technology;contract-form;contracts multiple times;Ethereum smart contract language Solidity;financial reputation damage;hacks;smart contract-based vulnerabilities;Solidity vulnerability scanner;unaudited smart contracts;vulnerable code snippets;web3 development;web3 security;Wormhole bridge hack,,,,20.0,IEEE,2 Feb 2023,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,False,True,True,

However, ML models themselves are vulnerable to adversarial examples, generated by deliberately adding subtle perturbation to the input sample that some people are not aware of, causing the model to give a false output with high confidence. In this article, our goal is to investigate the possibility of stealthy cyber attacks towards IDS, including injection attack, function code attack and reconnaissance attack, and enhance its robustness to adversarial attack. However, adversarial algorithms are subject to communication protocol and legal range of data in ICS, unlike only limited by the distance between original samples and newly generated samples in image domain. We propose two strategies - optimal solution attack and GAN attack - oriented to flexibility and volume of data, formulating an optimization problem to find stealthy attacks, where the former is appropriate for not too large and more flexible samples while the latter provides a more efficient solution for larger and not too flexible samples. Finally, we conduct experiments on a semi-physical ICS testbed with a high detection performance ensemble ML-based detector to show the effectiveness of our attacks. The results indicate that new samples of reconnaissance and function code attack produced by both optimal solution and GAN algorithm possess 80 percent higher probability to evade the detector, still maintaining the same attack effect.

Efficient identification of evolving malware is an urgent challenge. Traditional methods based on structured features such as permissions and sensitive application programming interface (API) calls lack high-level behavioral semantics to detect evolving malware. The methods based on call graphs (CG) are good at behavioral semantic analysis but face the problem of huge time and space consumption, which leads to low detection efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel Android malware detection method based on the method-level correlation relationship of application's abstracted API calls. First, we split each Android application's source code into separate function methods and just keep the abstracted API calls of them to form a set of abstracted API calls transactions. And then, we calculate the confidence of association rules between the abstracted API calls, which forms behavioral semantics to describe an application. Finally, we combine machine learning to identify the different behavioral patterns of malicious and benign apps to build the detection system. The results of our empirical evaluation show our system is competitive in terms of classification accuracy and detection efficiency. At dataset Drebin (benign 5.9K and malware 5.6K) and AMD (benign 20.5K and malware 20.8K), our system has achieved 96% and 98% detection results both in accuracy and F-measure.

Symbolic execution based feature extraction for detection of malware,N. Namani; A. Khan,"Bhabha Atomic Research Center, Mumbai, India; Bhabha Atomic Research Center, Mumbai, India","2020 5th International Conference on Computing, Communication and Security (ICCCS)",9 Dec 2020,2020.0,,,1,6,"Traditional signature-based Anti-virus (AV) detectors use signatures unique to known malware. But these signatures are manually extracted and cannot detect variants of the same malware or zero-day malware. For automatically detecting zero-day malware and variants of the known malware, Machine Learning (ML) based approaches are proposed by researchers. For an ML-based malware detector, features are extracted using malware analysis techniques like static and dynamic analysis. While dynamic analysis techniques are useful for observing the runtime behavior of the malware (such as API call sequences), it was widely observed that malware can detect the debugging environment and modify its behavior. Static analysis on the other hand is limited by code obfuscation techniques and packers. In addition, analysis of the disassembled code is primarily a manual process due to indirect jumps/calls presented in the disassembled code. To solve these indirect jumps/calls and to automatically extract API call sequences, we propose a symbolic execution based static feature extraction system. This system emulates the binary symbolically and extracts multiple API call sequences as opposed to a single API call sequence obtained in dynamic analysis. These API call sequences are processed and used as input features for the ML classifier. The resulting system using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) as a classifier, achieved a classification accuracy of 94.62% with the Area Under ROC Curve (AUC) of 0.9827.

We first create a diverse set of Spectre-V1 gadgets by introducing perturbations to the known gadgets. Using mutational fuzzing, we produce a data set with more than 1 million Spectre-V1 gadgets which is the largest Spectre gadget data set built to date. Next, we conduct the first empirical usability study of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in the context of assembly code generation without any human interaction. We introduce SpectreGAN which leverages masking implementation of GANs for both learning the gadget structures and generating new gadgets. This provides the first scalable solution to extend the variety of Spectre gadgets. Finally, we propose FastSpec which builds a classifier with the generated Spectre gadgets based on a novel high dimensional Neural Embeddings technique (BERT). For the case studies, we demonstrate that FastSpec discovers potential gadgets with a high success rate in OpenSSL libraries and Phoronix benchmarks. Further, FastSpec offers much greater flexibility and time-related performance gain compared to the existing tools and therefore can be used for gadget detection in large-scale software.",,978-1-6654-1491-3,10.1109/EuroSP51992.2021.00047,National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CNS-1814406); Intel Corporation;,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9581258,Spectre;Generative Adversarial Networks;Neural Embeddings;Vulnerability Analysis,Training;Codes;Perturbation methods;Scalability;Fuzzing;Tools;Performance gain,deep learning (artificial intelligence);program compilers;program debugging;security of data,Phoronix benchmarks;OpenSSL libraries;assembly code generation;generative adversarial networks;high dimensional neural embeddings technique;vulnerable spectre gadgets;gadget structures;deep learning techniques;fuzzing learning techniques;detection tool evaluations;commercial software;scalable generation;gadget detection,,2.0,,77.0,IEEE,4 Nov 2021,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,False,True,True,

However, the task of classifying malwares has become more challenging since the introduction of code obfuscation and metamorphism techniques.

Usually, these tasks are performed based on classical randomness-based measures or image quality assessment metrics. However, these methods have shown their inadequacy as a visual security metric, as they do not address content intelligibility, which represents an essential security requirement. Moreover, these methods are either dedicated to the prediction of visual security (VS) or visual quality (VQ), but not both.

However, in some State-of-the-art VM-based protection approaches, the set of virtual instructions and bytecode interpreters are fixed across the whole programs. This means an experienced attacker could extract the mapping information between virtual instructions and native code from programs, and use this knowledge to uncover the mapping relationships in similar protecting applications. To address this problem, we present CoDiver (Code Virtualization Protection with Diversity), a novel VM-based code obfuscation system in this paper. The main idea of our approach is to obfuscate the mapping between the opcodes of bytecode instructions and their semantics. To achieve this goal, we first turn every protected code region into multiple parts by partition proceeding, randomize the mapping of opcodes and their semantics of each part. By this way, we could translate the bytecode instruction into different native code in different sections of the obfuscated code. This method could increase the diversity of program behavior significantly. As a result, it will be useless to learn the mapping relationship between bytecode and native code of some other programs, then migrate it into a new program. We build a prototype of CoDiver and tested it on a set of real-world applications.

The document may appear normal in its format, but behave strangely or beyond users' expectation, sometimes lead to severe consequences when it is opened. Detecting malicious documents tops one of the most important tasks in modern information security. Malicious documents usually contain specific control codes inside which may cause the malicious shell code be executed automatically. The document control code is originally designed to enrich the documents' functionalities, but in this case, it may create vulnerabilities and then become a key to trigger attacks. Detecting control codes of certain pattern is a key to the success of malicious document detection. Different from previous research that was focused on detecting malicious documents of a particular format or containing specific control codes, we propose a method that analyzes the document objects from three general views: the use of functional words, preference words, and constant data. The functional words control how an attack is launched, and through what actions, if the document is considered a malicious one, the preference words usually suggest the favored word choices from document authors, and the constant data can be considered the bullets to complete the attack. We also propose a TF-IDF method to normalize the features to detect documents with mimicry attacks. Overall, given the three feature views, we detect malicious documents under a classification framework. We evaluate the proposed approach through series of experiments that use different view combinations for prediction, followed by some comparison of the proposed method to related work.",2376-6824,978-1-4799-2529-2,10.1109/TAAI.2013.43,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6783862,malicious document;multi-view;exploit;vulnerability;PDF,Feature extraction;Portable document format;Accuracy;Entropy;Data mining;Detectors;Information security,document handling;pattern classification;security of data,multiview malicious document detection;information security;malicious shell code;document control code;functional words;preference words;constant data;TF-IDF method;mimicry attacks;classification framework,,8.0,,13.0,IEEE,7 Apr 2014,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,False,True,True,

A reliable testing phase is essential to minimize the probability of app failures during execution. However, automated testing of mobile apps is still an open problem. The complexity of current apps makes their exploration more difficult than in the past because they can contain difficult-toreach states and difficult-to-trigger events. Several approaches exist to automate mobile apps’ testing phases whose aim is to maximize code coverage and bug detection. Random testing strategies produce pseudo-random events to stimulate the App Under Test. Model-based strategies combine static and dynamic analysis to create navigation models and generate test cases.

Not only does such an attack compromise code confidentiality, it can also reveal critical information on the system's internals. Being easily accessible to a vast number of end users, modern embedded devices are highly vulnerable against disassembly attacks. To protect them, designers deploy countermeasures and verify their efficiency in security laboratories. Clearly, any vulnerability discovered at that point, after the integrated circuit has been manufactured, represents an important setback. In this paper, we address the above issues in two steps: Firstly, we design a framework that takes a design netlist and outputs simulated power side-channel traces, with the goal of assessing the vulnerability of the device at design time. Secondly, we propose a novel side-channel disassembler, based on multilayer perceptron and sparse dictionary learning for feature engineering.

In fact, there exist three types of procedural noise, and we evaluate the attack ability of triggers generated by them on the different classification datasets, including CIFAR-10, GTSRB, CelebA, and ImageNet12. The experiment results show that our attack approach can bypass most defense approaches, even for the inspections of humans. We only need poison 5%–10% training data, but the attack success rate(ASR) can reach over 99%. To test the robustness of the backdoor model against the corruption methods that in practice, we introduce 17 corruption methods and compute the accuracy, ASR of the backdoor model with them.

Intrusion Detection System (IDS) which can identify malicious network attacks has become a strong tool to ensure network security. Many deep learning-based approaches have been used in IDS. However, most of these researches ignore the internal structural characteristics of the network traffic, and cannot accurately learn the key features of the malicious traffic. Thus, they have a low accuracy in classifying different kinds of network attacks. In this paper, we build an intrusion detection model DAL (Dense-Attention-LSTM, DAL), in which dense dilated convolutions is used to extract the underlying features of the network traffic. Then, attention mechanism is utilized to capture key features which represent the structural characteristics of traffic data. Moreover, CuDNN-based long short-term memory network is used to learn time-related information of the traffic while accelerating the convergence of the model. Finally, global maxpooling is adopted to compress data and to improve the generalization capabilities of the proposed model. Experimental results on UNSW-NB15 dataset show that the binary classification accuracy of the proposed model is up to 92.65%. Further, it can also identify various attacks with the accuracy of 81.28%. The performance of our model is better than some competing machine learning methods and some deep learning methods.

In such a service environment, if a mobile application is vulnerable to security threats and exposed to malicious behavior, malware can spread to hundreds of millions of connected devices. In particular, it is important to isolate and respond quickly to malicious mobile code. This requires the prediction of malicious behavior. Currently, security risk assessment schemes based on the permission use the description of the application or user review, but these schemes mostly offer a subjective evaluation, which inevitably reduces accuracy. In this paper, we thus propose a scheme for assessing security risk of Android mobile applications by analyzing their application programming interfaces (APIs) using machine learning. The key idea of the proposed scheme is to extract the APIs from the execution code of the application with reverse engineering analysis, such that each API can be compared with the malicious API database built from the existing malware dataset. Instead of simply judging the applications as malicious or benign, our scheme shows their risk as a score. To do this quantitative evaluation, we use an ensemble of tree boosting machine learning algorithms. To prove the practicality of the proposed scheme, we experiment with a set of benign and malicious real world samples, and compare our results with existing schemes. Experimental results show better performance and accuracy than conventional schemes based on Naive Bayes and simple ensemble algorithms.

Although fuzzing shows excellent results for code coverage and crash count, it is not easy to apply these effects to library fuzzing. A library cannot run independently; it is only executed by an application called a customer program. In particular, a fuzzing executable and a seed corpus are needed to execute the library code by calling a specific function sequence and passing the input of the fuzzer to reproduce the various states of the library. However, preparing the environment for library fuzzing is challenging because it relies on the human expertise and requires both an understanding of the library and fuzzing knowledge.

Increasingly, attackers treat these security fixing patches as resources, using them for the development of new exploits against those systems that have not yet adopted all of the most recent patches. In this work, we present PatchSweetner: a novel, automated system that aims to turn the security threat posed by security patches into a resource for defending computer systems. Our PatchSweetner system inputs security fixing patches and outputs honey patches, patches that detect the abuse of the previously existing vulnerability. Our system derives these honey patches by automatically reformulating the source code of the input security patches. This reformulation is achieved through a combination of hand-coded heuristics and a machine learned model, that localize those changes within a security fixing patch that alter the attacker input driven control flow. Using PatchSweetner we have automatically derived more than 100 different exploitation detecting honey patches from an input of more than 1000 different open source, security fixing, patches.

Most of these malware programs are malware variants such as polymorphic and metamorphic malware, which are created from older versions of malware and able to change their structures and function flows to circumvent security solutions. The accuracy of malware variant detection is a crucial challenge. Many existing malware variant detections use static features extracted from the physical structure of malware file, such as opcodes and function flows. Unfortunately, the static features are subject to obfuscation and code shelling using simple obfuscation techniques. Although a malware variant can change its structure and function flows, it is widely believed that the malware variant cannot hide its malicious behavioral patterns during the runtime. Accordingly, dynamic, or behavioral analysis-based features were suggested by many studies to detect malware variants accurately. However, most of these studies are solely dependent on application-programmable interface calls (or API calls), which is not enough to accurately distinguish between malware and benign due to API-based obfuscation techniques. Therefore, a malware variant detection model that combines different behavioral activities can improve detection accuracy while reducing the false-negative rate. To this end, this study proposed a Deep-Ensemble and Multifaceted Behavioral Malware Variant Detection Model using Sequential Deep Learning and Extreme Gradient Boosting Techniques. Different behavioral features were extracted from the dynamic analysis environment. Then, a feature extraction algorithm that can automatically extract effective representative patterns has been designed and developed to extract the hidden representative features of the malware variants using a sequential deep learning model. These features have been fed into a developed extreme gradient boosting-based classifier for decision making. Extensive experiments have been carried out to validate the proposed scheme.

The propounded approach entails tagging Malayalam-English code-mixed data set with six labels: Malayalam (mal), English (eng), acronyms (acr), universal (univ), mixed (mix) and undefined (undef). Newly developed corpus of Malayalam-English was deployed for appraisal of the effectiveness of state-of-the-art models like BERT.

Given that these binary files are commonly closed source, users or businesses who want to assess the security of the software need to rely on reverse engineering. Further, verifying the correct application of the latest software patches in a given binary is an open problem. The regular application of software patches is a central pillar for improving mobile and IoT device security. This requires developers, integrators, and vendors to propagate patches to all affected devices in a timely and coordinated fashion. In practice, vendors follow different and sometimes improper security update agendas for both mobile and IoT products. Moreover, previous studies revealed the existence of a hidden patch gap: several vendors falsely reported that they patched vulnerabilities. Therefore, techniques to verify whether vulnerabilities have been patched or not in a given binary are essential. Deep learning approaches have shown to be promising for static binary analyses with respect to inferring binary similarity as well as vulnerability detection. However, these approaches fail to capture the dynamic behavior of these systems, and, as a result, they may inundate the analysis with false positives when performing vulnerability discovery in the wild. In particular, they cannot capture the fine-grained characteristics necessary to distinguish whether a vulnerability has been patched or not. In this paper, we present PATCHECKO, a vulnerability and patch presence detection framework for executable binaries. PATCHECKO relies on a hybrid, cross-platform binary code similarity analysis that combines deep learning-based static binary analysis with dynamic binary analysis. PATCHECKO does not require access to the source code of the target binary nor that of vulnerable functions. We evaluate PATCHECKO on the most recent Google Pixel 2 smartphone and the Android Things IoT firmware images, within which 25 known CVE vulnerabilities have been previously reported and patched. Our deep learning model shows a vulnerability detection accuracy of over 93%. We further prune the candidates found by the deep learning stage–which includes false positives–via dynamic binary analysis. Consequently, PATCHECKO successfully identifies the correct matches among the candidate functions in the top 3 ranked outcomes 100% of the time. Furthermore, PATCHECKO's differential engine distinguishes between functions that are still vulnerable and those that are patched with an accuracy of 96%.",1530-0889,978-1-7281-5809-9,10.1109/DSN48063.2020.00053,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9153399,Deep Learning;Dynamic Analysis;Patch;Firmware Vulnerabilities;Mobile;IoT,Software;Machine learning;Security;Libraries;Static analysis;Androids;Humanoid robots,,,,7.0,,44.0,IEEE,31 Jul 2020,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,False,True,True,

From this starting point, in this paper, we conduct an empirical study to evaluate different program representation techniques.

Numerous underwater image enhancement algorithms have been proposed in the last few years. However, these algorithms are mainly evaluated using either synthetic datasets or few selected real-world images. It is thus unclear how these algorithms would perform on images acquired in the wild and how we could gauge the progress in the field. To bridge this gap, we present the first comprehensive perceptual study and analysis of underwater image enhancement using large-scale real-world images. In this paper, we construct an Underwater Image Enhancement Benchmark (UIEB) including 950 real-world underwater images, 890 of which have the corresponding reference images. We treat the rest 60 underwater images which cannot obtain satisfactory reference images as challenging data. Using this dataset, we conduct a comprehensive study of the state-of-the-art underwater image enhancement algorithms qualitatively and quantitatively.

However, the high communication cost of traditional ML approaches coupled with data privacy issues makes them unpractical for many IoT applications, especially in healthcare where medical records contain sensitive information that can compromise patient privacy. As a result, current research has begun to investigate Federated Learning (FL) as a new paradigm addressing these critical concerns by training ML models without sharing private data. This paper provides a comprehensive study of existing FL algorithms and discusses their applicability in a medical IoT context using publicly available datasets. This is proceeded by integrating such schemes in the FedML framework using real-world medical datasets in both simulated and on-device federated settings to investigate the impact of clients number, communication loss, and data compression on model performance, energy, time, and code footprint.

Is the source code plagiarized, and does it infringe on copyright? Source Code Authorship Attribution is done by observing distinctive patterns of style in a source code whose author is unknown and comparing them with patterns learned from known authors' source codes. In this paper, we present an efficient approach to learn a novel representation using deep metric learning. The existing state of the art approaches tokenize the source code and work on the keyword level, limiting the elements of style they can consider. Our approach uses the raw character stream of source code. It can examine keywords and different stylistic features such as variable naming conventions or using tabs vs. spaces, enabling us to learn a richer representation than other keyword-based approaches. Our approach uses a character-level Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). We train the CNN to map the input character stream to a dense vector, mapping the source codes authored by the same author close to each other. In contrast, source codes written by different programmers are mapped farther apart in the embedding space. We then feed these source code vectors into the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier that uses Manhattan-distance to perform authorship attribution. We validated our approach on Google Code Jam (GCJ) dataset across three different programming languages. We prepare our large-scale dataset in such a way that it does not induce type-I error.

We propose to use Auto-encoders (AEs), as a generative model, to learn latent representation of different feature sets. We show how well the AE is capable of automatically learning a reasonable notion of semantic similarity among input features. Specifically, the AE accepts a feature vector, obtained from cyber security phenomena, and extracts a code vector that captures the semantic similarity between the feature vectors. This similarity is embedded in an abstract latent representation. Because the AE is trained in an unsupervised fashion, the main part of this success comes from appropriate original feature set that is used in this paper. It can also provide more discriminative features in contrast to other feature engineering approaches. Furthermore, the scheme can reduce the dimensionality of the features thereby signicantly minimising the memory requirements.

These systems are attractive to hackers because they contain essential data, and great care must be taken to prevent unauthorized access to the database layer. SQL Injection attacks (SQLIA) are one of the most common web applications (WA) threats. SQL injection, more often known as SQL Injection (SQLI), is a different attack method that involves injecting malicious SQL code into a database. Thanks to deep learning algorithms, the classification can be performed without manual feature extraction. It has been proposed a Specially Designed two-dimensional convolutional neural network (2D-CNN) architecture built using python. Further, the proposed 2D-CNN can be extracted automatic features from numerical data. Here, binary classify (normal and malicious queries) was applied. While this dataset is one-dimensional text, these are transformed into the two-dimensional matrix with word embedding (Skip-Gram Model) technique taking both context and syntax information from SQL into consideration for extracting low-dimensional vector representations of words and feature engineering using a neural network. Technically, this process would increase the classification accuracy detection of SQLIA with high harmony. The dataset from Kaggle.com, which includes all major types of SQL attacks, was used to test the proposed Model.

Many forms of IoT devices will be developed and used across industry verticals. However, the euphoria of this technology adoption is shadowed by the solemn presence of cyber threats that will follow its growth trajectory. Cyber threats would either embed their malicious code or attack vulnerabilities in IoT that could induce significant consequences in cyber and physical realms. In order to manage such destructive effects, incident responders and cyber investigators require the capabilities to find these rogue IoT, contain them quickly and protect other legitimate IoTs from attacks. Such online devices may only leave network activity traces. A collection of relevant traces could be used to infer the IoT's network behavioral fingerprints and in turn could facilitate investigative find of these IoT. However, the challenge is how to infer these fingerprints when there are limited network activity traces.

Malware's are written in such a way that they get mutated frequently but the original algorithm remains the same. To distinguish a malware, systems like conduct based location, signature based identification and machine learning based procedures are utilized. The mark based discovery framework falls flat in the event that it experiences another obscure malware. In the event of conduct based identification framework, if the antivirus program distinguishes any odd conduct over web then it will produce alert flag, yet there is a high false positive rate as it is inclined to arrange kind records as malware. Machine learning methodology is proposed to detect the malware where feature extraction is based on opcodes in the executable file of the malware. Opcodes of the malware can be extracted into a text file using disassemblers like IDA pro.

Commonly used onboarding techniques today include the use of QR codes, pin codes, or serial numbers. These techniques typically do not protect against unauthorized device access-a QR code is physically printed on the device, while a pin code may be included in the device packaging. As a result, any entity that has physical access to a device can onboard it onto their network and, potentially, tamper it (e.g., install malware on the device). To address this problem, in this paper, we present a framework, called Deep Learning-based Watermarking for authorized IoT onboarding (DLWIoT), featuring a robust and fully automated image watermarking scheme based on deep neural networks. DLWIoT embeds user credentials into carrier images (e.g., QR codes printed on IoT devices), thus enables IoT onboarding only by authorized users.

More importantly, some adversarial examples crafted against an ensemble of source models transfer to other target models and, thus, pose a security threat to black-box applications (when attackers have no access to the target models). Current transfer-based ensemble attacks, however, only consider a limited number of source models to craft an adversarial example and, thus, obtain poor transferability. Besides, recent query-based black-box attacks, which require numerous queries to the target model, not only come under suspicion by the target model but also cause expensive query cost. In this article, we propose a novel transfer-based black-box attack, dubbed serial-minigroup-ensemble-attack (SMGEA). Concretely, SMGEA first divides a large number of pretrained white-box source models into several “minigroups.” For each minigroup, we design three new ensemble strategies to improve the intragroup transferability. Moreover, we propose a new algorithm that recursively accumulates the “long-term” gradient memories of the previous minigroup to the subsequent minigroup. This way, the learned adversarial information can be preserved, and the intergroup transferability can be improved. Experiments indicate that SMGEA not only achieves state-of-the-art black-box attack ability over several data sets but also deceives two online black-box saliency prediction systems in real world, i.e., DeepGaze-II (https://deepgaze.bethgelab.org/) and SALICON (http://salicon.net/demo/).

However, deep learning algorithms are known to be vulnerable to carefully crafted input known as adversarial examples which makes it possible for an attacker to fool an AI system. In this work, we explored the mechanism behind the YOLO object detector and proposed an optimization method to craft adversarial examples to attack the YOLO model. The experiment shows that this white box attack method is effective and has a success rate of 100% in crafting digital adversarial examples to fool the YOLO model.

Post the Mirai-based DDoS attack in 2016 which compromised IoT devices, a host of new malware using Mirai’s leaked source code and targeting IoT devices have cropped up, e.g. Satori, Reaper, Amnesia, Masuta etc. These malware exploit software vulnerabilities to infect IoT devices instead of open TELNET ports (like Mirai) making them more difficult to block using existing solutions such as firewalls.

The model-based methods have good generalization ability, while the runtime can hardly meet the fast processing requirements of the practical situations due to the large size of an HSI  ${\mathbf {X}}\in \mathbb {R}^{\textrm {MN}\times B}$ . For the data-based methods, they perform relatively fast on new test data once they have been trained. However, their generalization ability is always insufficient. In this article, we propose a fast model-based approach via a novel regularizer named the representative coefficient total variation (RCTV) to simultaneously characterize the low-rank and local smooth properties. The RCTV regularizer is proposed based on the observation that the representative coefficient matrix  ${\mathbf {U}}\in \mathbb {R}^{\textrm {MN}\times R} (R\ll B)$  obtained by orthogonally transforming the original HSI  ${\mathbf {X}}$  can inherit the strong local-smooth prior of  ${\mathbf {X}}$ . Since  $R/B$  is very small, the model based on the RCTV regularizer has lower time complexity. In addition, we find that the representative coefficient matrix  ${\mathbf {U}}$  is robust to noise, and thus, the RCTV regularizer can somewhat promote the robustness of the HSI denoising model. Extensive experiments on mixed noise removal demonstrate that the proposed method realizes a perfect compromise between denoising performance and denoising speed compared with other state-of-the-art methods. Remarkably, the denoising speed of our proposed method outperforms all competing model-based techniques and is comparable with the deep learning-based approaches.

Automated code verification based on software model checking provides promise for early identification of such behaviors; however, it faces inherent challenges w.r.t. scalability, soft real-time behaviors, and the need for pre-specified thresholds, that significantly limits its usefulness for verifying SDN networks in practice. We describe an approach that enhances automated verification with machine learning-based analytics to detect and identify faulty or malicious behaviors that can compromise network reliability, performance, and security. A novel aspect of our work is that the analytics algorithms learn on information provided by automated verification, coupled with real-time inputs and outputs, to learn thresholds that can be used in software model checking, and to identify anomalous execution paths of network applications that may compromise the underlying SDN network.

When machine learning on large data sets is processed directly on an existing SQL database server, the data does not need to be exported and transferred to a separate big data processing platform. To achieve this, we implement a linear regression algorithm using SQL code generation such that the computation can be performed server-side and directly in the RDBMs. Our method and its implementation, programmed in Python, solves linear regression (LR) using the ordinary least squares (OLS) method directly in the RDBMS using SQL code generation, leaving most of the processing in the database. Only the matrix of the system of equations, whose size is equal to the number of variables squared, is transferred from the SQL server to the Python client to be solved for OLS regression. For evaluation purposes, our LR implementation was tested with artificially generated datasets and compared to an existing Python library (Scikit Learn). We found that our implementation consistently solves OLS regression faster than Scikit Learn for datasets with more than 10,000 input rows, and if the number of columns is less than 64. Moreover, under the same test conditions where the computation is larger than memory, our implementation showed a fast result, while Scikit returned an out-of-memory error.

There are differences between any spoken-language (sequence of words/sentences) and the machine-language (sequence of op-codes). In this paper we demonstrate that due to these inherent differences, an LSTM model with its default configuration as tuned for a spoken-language, may not work well to detect malware (using its op-code sequence) unless the network’s essential hyper-parameters are tuned appropriately. In the process, we also determine the relative importance of all the different hyper-parameters of an LSTM network as applied to malware detection using their op-code sequence representations. We experimented with different configurations of LSTM networks, and altered hyper-parameters like the embedding-size, number of hidden-layers, number of LSTM-units in a hidden layers, pruning/padding-length of the input-vector, activation-function, and batch-size.

This renders the attack undetectable from a DNN operation perspective. We propose a DNN defense mechanism to improve robustness in such realistic stealthy weight bit-flip attack scenarios.

Practitioners who manage authentication secrets such as textual passwords and API keys in the source code may accidentally leave these texts in the public repositories, resulting in secret leakage. If such leakage in the source code can be automatically detected in time, potential damage would be avoided. With existing approaches focusing on detecting secrets with distinctive formats (e.g., API keys, cryptographic keys in PEM format), textual passwords, which are ubiquitously used for authentication, fall through the crack. Given that textual passwords could be virtually any strings, a naive detection scheme based on regular expression performs poorly. This paper presents PassFinder, an automated approach to effectively detecting password leakage from public repositories that involve various programming languages on a large scale. PassFinder utilizes deep neural networks to unveil the intrinsic characteristics of textual passwords and understand the semantics of the code snippets that use textual passwords for authentication, i.e., the contextual information of the passwords in the source code. Using this new technique, we performed the first large-scale and longitudinal analysis of password leakage on GitHub.

From information theory, it is known that wiretap codes can asymptotically achieve reliability (vanishing block error rate (BLER) at the legitimate receiver Bob) while also achieving secrecy (vanishing information leakage (IL) to an eavesdropper Eve). However, under finite block length, there exists a tradeoff between the BLER at Bob and the IL at Eve. In this work, we propose a flexible wiretap code design for degraded Gaussian wiretap channels under finite block length, which can change the operating point on the Pareto boundary of the tradeoff between BLER and IL given specific code parameters. To attain this goal, we formulate a multi-objective programming problem, which takes the BLER at Bob and the IL at Eve into account. During training, we approximate the BLER by the mean square error and the IL by schemes based on Jensen's inequality and the Taylor expansion and then solve the optimization problem by neural network autoencoders.

As recently shown, DDoS attacks triggered by Mirai-alike IoT-based botnets go far beyond traditional pre-2016 DDoS attacks since they have a much higher amplification and their propagation is far more aggressive. Thus, it is of crucial importance to tailor botnet detection schemes accordingly. This work provides a novel DNS-based profiling scheme over real datasets of Mirai-alike botnet activity captured on honeypots that are globally distributed. We firstly discuss features used in profiling botnets in the past and indicate how profiling IoT-based botnets in particular can be improved by leveraging DNS information out of a single DNS record. We further conduct an evaluation of our developed feature set over various Machine Learning (ML) classifiers and demonstrate the applicability of our scheme. Our resulted outputs indicate that the proposed feature set can significantly reduce botnet detection time whilst simultaneously maintaining high levels of accuracy of 99% on average under the random forest formulation.",2576-6813,978-1-7281-0962-6,10.1109/GLOBECOM38437.2019.9014300,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9014300,,Botnet;IP networks;Computer crime;Malware;Servers;Blacklisting;Tools,computer network security;Internet of Things;invasive software;learning (artificial intelligence);random forests;telecommunication traffic,botnet detection schemes;Internet-wide security;random forest formulation;machine learning classifiers;DNS-based profiling scheme;IoT-based botnet traffic;botnet detection time;IoT devices;Mirai's base malware code;Mirai-alike IoT-based botnets;large-scale DDoS attacks,,10.0,,12.0,IEEE,27 Feb 2020,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,False,True,True,

Since the response bits are physically derived, there is noise present. To generate bit-exact cryptographic keys, error correction algorithms are used. The error correction is typically split into small processing blocks to reduce implementation complexity. The reliability of PUF responses varies from bit to bit, but there has been very little work so far that mathematically analyzes the effect of the block size on the reliability of PUF response sequences. We use the information theoretical concept of typicality to show that the probability of drawing an unreliable sequence decreases exponentially with the block size. We present differential sequence coding that scales efficiently across larger block sizes without having the super-linear increase in decoding complexity of prior approaches. It scans the entire PUF response sequentially and then only operates on one single, maximally reliable, block to generate the cryptographic key. Our sample FPGA implementation with a convolutional code is designed for a popular SRAM PUF scenario. It generates a 128-bit key for an average input bit error probability of 15% with an output bit error probability of 6.14 · 10-9 and only uses 974 PUF bits and 1, 108 helper data bits.

Infrastructure companies use passive testing approaches such as anomaly-based intrusion detection systems to observe such systems and prevent attacks. However, the effectiveness of intrusion detection systems depends on the underlying models used for detecting attacks and the observations that may suffer from scarce data availability. Hence, we need research on a) passive testing methods for obtaining appropriate detection models and b) for analysing the impact of the scarceness of data for improving intrusion detection systems. In this paper, we contribute to these challenges. We build on former work on supervised intrusion detection of power grid substation SCADA network traffic where a real-world data set (APG data set) is available. In contrast to previous work, we use a semi-supervised model with recurrent neural network architectures (i.e., LSTM Autoencoders and sequence models). This model only considers samples of ordinary data traffic without attacks to learn an adequate detection model. We outline the underlying foundations regarding the machine learning approach used.

To protect users from such threads, the development of an accurate detection system for malicious JS is soliciting. Conventional approaches often employ signature and heuristic-based methods, which are prone to suffer from zero-day attacks, i.e., causing many false negatives and/or false positives.

We define 3 data types of data segment, then design several data segment byte feature extraction methods to construct feature sequences, and finally present a deep learning-based approach with feature sequences as input to recognize the data type byte by byte.

We implement a prototype system and evaluate it with our dataset, then determine reasonable models and hyperparameters through several experiments, and eventually confirm that deep learning techniques are suitable for identifying the data type in data segment.

In recent times, vulnerabilities in the architecture were discovered and exploited to mount and execute a state-of-the-art attack such as Spectre. The Spectre attack exploits a vulnerability in the Intel-based processors to leak confidential data through the covert channel. There exist some defenses to mitigate the Spectre attack. Among multiple defenses, hardware-assisted attack/intrusion detection (HID) systems have received overwhelming response due to its low overhead and efficient attack detection. The HID systems deploy machine learning (ML) classifiers to perform anomaly detection to determine whether the system is under attack. For this purpose, a performance monitoring tool profiles the applications to record hardware performance counters (HPC), utilized for anomaly detection. Previous HID systems assume that the Spectre is executed as a standalone application. In contrast, we propose an attack that dynamically generates variations in the injected code to evade detection. The attack is injected into a benign application. In this manner, the attack conceals itself as a benign application and gen-erates perturbations to avoid detection. For the attack injection, we exploit a return-oriented programming (ROP)-based code-injection technique that reuses the code, called gadgets, present in the exploited victim's (host) memory to execute the attack, which, in our case, is the CR-Spectre attack to steal sensitive data from a target victim (target) application. Our work focuses on proposing a dynamic attack that can evade HID detection by injecting perturbations, and its dynamically generated variations thereof, under the cloak of a benign application. We evaluate the proposed attack on the MiBench suite as the host. From our experiments, the HID performance degrades from 90% to 16%, indicating our Spectre-CR attack avoids detection successfully.",1558-1101,978-3-9819263-6-1,10.23919/DATE54114.2022.9774750,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9774750,,Codes;Program processors;Perturbation methods;Side-channel attacks;Machine learning;Programming;Malware,computer crime;invasive software;learning (artificial intelligence),defense-aware ROP injected code-reuse;dynamic Spectre;side-channel attacks;attack detection;anomaly detection;benign application;attack injection;return-oriented programming-based code-injection technique;CR-Spectre attack;dynamic attack;HID detection;Spectre-CR attack avoids detection;HID systems;machine learning classifiers;hardware-assisted attack/intrusion detection systems;hardware performance counters,,,,24.0,,19 May 2022,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,False,True,True,

However, being AIS communications neither encrypted nor authenticated, they can be eavesdropped and spoofed by adversaries, leading to potentially threatening scenarios. Existing solutions, including the ones conceived in the avionics domain, do not consider integration with the AIS standard, and they do not provide protection against rogue messages flooding. In this article, we propose Auth-AIS, a secure, flexible, standard-compliant, and backward-compatible authentication framework to secure AIS broadcast messages. Auth-AIS leverages existing sound cryptographic tools, including TESLA and Bloom Filters, inheriting their security properties while contextualizing them in the AIS technology. Auth-AIS is a software-only solution, that can be seamlessly integrated into existing AIS deployments, without requiring any hardware replacement. Its innovative design also provides backward-compatibility—i.e., Auth-AIS messages can be received also by AIS users not adopting Auth-AIS, while renouncing at its security guarantees. Auth-AIS can work in either two configuration modes: Deterministic Security Configuration, able to achieve low-delay authentication with a message overhead of 75 percent, or Probabilistic Security Configuration, reducing the message overhead down to 35.71 percent, while experiencing a marginal increase in the authentication delay. All these security configurations guarantee an 80 bits equivalent security level and false-positive rate less than 2--40. Note that these latter security parameters can easily be tuned to fit different security requirements. Finally, the source code of Auth-AIS in the GNURadio ecosystem has been released as open-source, to foster research activities from both Industry and Academia on secure AIS communications.",1941-0018,,10.1109/TDSC.2021.3069428,Qatar National Research Fund(grant numbers:NPRP-S-11-0109-180242);,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9390297,AIS;vessels cybersecurity;broadcast authentication;cyber-physical systems security,Artificial intelligence;Security;Transceivers;Authentication;Standards;Tools;Protocols,broadcast communication;cryptographic protocols;Global Positioning System;marine navigation;message authentication;telecommunication security,AIS standard;secure authentication framework;flexible authentication framework;backward-compatible authentication framework;secure AIS broadcast messages;AIS technology;Auth-AIS messages;AIS users;secure AIS communications;AIS deployments;standard-compliant authentication framework;vessel AIS broadcasts;Automatic Identification System;avionics domain;sound cryptographic tools;TESLA;Bloom filters;security properties;deterministic security configuration;low-delay authentication;probabilistic security configuration;GNURadio ecosystem,,6.0,,48.0,IEEE,30 Mar 2021,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals,False,True,True,

Locally Interpretable One-Class Anomaly Detection for Credit Card Fraud Detection,T. -Y. Wu; Y. -T. Wang,National Taiwain University; National Taiwain University,2021 International Conference on Technologies and Applications of Artificial Intelligence (TAAI),23 May 2022,2021.0,,,25,30,"For the highly imbalanced credit card fraud detection problem, most existing methods either use data augmentation methods or conventional machine learning models, while anomaly-detection-based approaches are not sufficient. Furthermore, few studies have employed AI interpretability tools to investigate the feature importance of transaction data, which is crucial for the black-box fraud detection module. Considering these two points together, we propose a novel anomaly detection framework for credit card fraud detection as well as a model-explaining module responsible for prediction explanations. The fraud detection model is composed of two deep neural networks, which are trained in an unsupervised and adversarial manner. Precisely, the generator is an AutoEncoder aiming to reconstruct genuine transaction data, while the discriminator is a fully-connected network for fraud detection. The explanation module has three white-box explainers in charge of interpretations of the AutoEncoder, discriminator, and the whole detection model, respectively. Experimental results show the state-of-the-art performances of our fraud detection model on the benchmark dataset compared with baselines. In addition, prediction analyses by three explainers are presented, offering a clear perspective on how each feature of an instance of interest contributes to the final model output.

This has made the user even more vulnerable to malicious attacks than ever before. We aim to address this problem by proposing a novel framework to identify potential Android malware apps by extracting the intention and their permission requests. First, we constructed a dataset consisting of 1,730 benign apps along with 273 malware samples. Then, both datasets were subjected to source code extraction. From there on, we followed a two phase approach to identify potential malware samples. In phase 1, we constructed a machine learning model to group benign apps into different clusters based on their operations known as the task-intention. Once we trained the model, it was used to identify the task-intention of an Android app. Further, in this phase, we only used the benign apps to construct the task-intentions and none of the malware signatures were involved. Therefore, our approach does not use machine learning models to identify malware apps. Then, for each task-intention group, we extracted the permission-requests of the apps and constructed the probability mass functions (PMF). We named the shape of this PMF as Intention-Shape or I-Shape. In phase 2, we used the permission-requests, task-intentions and I-Shapes to identify potential malware apps. We compared the permission-requests of an unknown app with its corresponding I-Shape to identify the potential malware apps. Using this approach, we obtained an accuracy of 89% in detecting potential malware samples. The novelty of our work is to perform potential malware identification without training any models with malware signatures, and utilization of I-Shapes to identify such potential malware samples. Our approach can be utilized to identify the safety of an app before it is installed as it performs static code analysis. Further, it can be utilized in pre-screening or multi-layer security systems.

To circumvent the former problem, we propose a novel algorithm that attacks semantic similarity on feature representations. In this way, we are able to fool classifiers without limiting attacks to a specific dataset. For imperceptibility, we introduce the low-frequency constraint to limit perturbations within high-frequency components, ensuring perceptual similarity between adversarial examples and originals. Extensive experiments on three datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-1K) and three public online platforms indicate that our attack can yield misleading and transferable adversarial examples across architectures and datasets.

It is reported in the literature that the traditional SQL injection detection algorithms fail to prevent this type of attack. In this paper, we propose a machine learning based heuristic algorithm to prevent the SQL injection attack. We use a dataset of 616 SQL statements to train and test 23 different machine learning classifiers.

The attack exploits vulnerabilities in web browsers and their extensions for unnoticeably downloading malicious software. Often, the victim is sent through a long chain of redirection operations in order to take down the offending pages. Concretely, the attack is triggered when a user visits a benign webpage that is compromised by the attacker (called landing page) and is inserted some malicious code inside. The user is then automatically redirected to an actual page that installs malware on the user's computer (called distribution page) without his/her consent or knowledge. While there is a large body of works targeting on detection of drive-by download attack, there is little attention on the redirection which is a crucial characteristic of the attack. In this paper, for the first time, we propose an approach to the classification of landing and distribution domains which are important components forming the head and tail of a redirection chain in the attack. The methodology in our approach is to use machine learning for text mining on the registered information of the domains called whois.

In theory, such distributed machine learning techniques have great potential in distributed applications, in which data are typically generated and collected at the client-side while the collected data should be processed by the application deployed at the server-side. However, there is still a significant gap in evaluating the performance of those techniques concerning their practicality in the Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled distributed systems constituted by resource-constrained devices. This work is the first attempt to provide empirical comparisons of FL and SplitNN in real-world IoT settings in terms of learning performance and device implementation overhead. We consider a variety of datasets, different model architectures, multiple clients, and various performance metrics. For the learning performance (i.e., model accuracy and convergence time), we empirically evaluate both FL and SplitNN under different types of data distributions such as imbalanced and non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. We show that the learning performance of SplitNN is better than FL under an imbalanced data distribution but worse than FL under an extreme non-IID data distribution. For implementation overhead, we mount both FL and SplitNN on Raspberry Pi devices and comprehensively evaluate their overhead, including training time, communication overhead, power consumption, and memory usage. Our key observations are that under the IoT scenario where the communication traffic is the primary concern, FL appears to perform better over SplitNN because FL has a significantly lower communication overhead compared with SplitNN. However, our experimental results also demonstrate that neither FL or SplitNN can be applied to a heavy model, e.g., with several million parameters, on resource-constrained IoT devices because its training cost would be too expensive for such devices.

Traditional MTC methods based on port, payload, and statistic depend on the manual-designed features, which have low accuracy. Recently, deep-learning methods have attracted a significant attention due to their high accuracy in terms of classification. However, in practical application scenarios, deep-learning methods require a large amount of labeled samples for training, while the available labeled samples for training are very rare. Furthermore, the preparation of a large amount of labeled samples requires a lot of labor costs. To solve these problems, this article proposes three methods based on semisupervised learning (SSL), transfer learning (TL), and domain adaptive (DA), respectively. Our proposed methods use a large amount of unlabeled data collected in the Internet traffic, which can greatly improve the classification accuracy with few labeled samples. Then, we use the DA method to solve the mismatch problem between the source domain and the target domain in the TL process. The proposed method is not only applicable to the shallow network but also to the deep neural network structure, and can achieve better classification results. Experimental results show that our proposed methods can satisfy the requirement of MTC in the case of few labeled samples in IIoT.

Thus, trained artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms such as Support vector machine (SVM) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) have been proposed to recognize distinct and discriminant features of biometric information (intrinsic hand features and demographic cues) with good classification accuracy. Unfortunately, due to nonlinearity in distinct and discriminant features of biometric information, accuracy of SVM and ANFIS is reduced. As a result, optimized AI algorithms ((ANFIS) with subtractive clustering (ANFIS-SC) and SVM with error correction output code (SVM-ECOC)) have shown to be effective for biometric information recognition. In this paper, we compare the performance of the ANFIS-SC and SVM-ECOC algorithms in their effectiveness at learning essential characteristics of intrinsic hand features and demographic cues based on Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) feature selection. Furthermore, the accuracy of these algorithms are presented, and their recognition performances are evaluated by root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), scatter index (SI), mean absolute deviation (MAD), coefficient of determination  $(R^{2})$ , Akaike’s Information Criterion (AICc) and Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency index (NSE).

Firstly, the more comprehensive and essential features of malicious code are obtained by extracting local feature information, assembly instruction set information and visible string information. Secondly, in order to solve the problem of inconsistent images generated by feature sequences, different feature grayscale images are fused into a multi-channel mapping feature image (2MFI) based on the signature matrix.

Non-Random Weight Initialisation in Deep Learning Networks for Repeatable Determinism,R. N. M. Rudd-Orthner; L.

These research experiments require to make measurements and comparisons from a stable set of known weights and biases before and after learning is conducted, such that comparisons after learning are repeatable and the experiment is controlled. As such the current accepted schemes of random number initialisations of the weight values may need to be deterministic rather than stochastic to have little run to run varying effects, so that the weight value initialisations are not a varying contributor. This paper looks at the viability of non-random weight initialisation schemes, to be used in place of the random number weight initialisations of an established well understood test case. The viability of non-random weight initialisation schemes in neural networks may make a network more deterministic in learning sessions which is a desirable property in mission and safety critical systems. The paper will use a variety of schemes over number ranges and gradients and will achieve a 97.97% accuracy figure just 0.18% less than the original random number scheme at 98.05%. The paper may highlight that in this case it may be the number range and not the gradient that is effecting the achieved accuracy most dominantly, although there may be a coupling of number range with activation functions used. Unexpectedly in this paper, an effect of numerical instability will be discovered from run to run when run on a multi-core CPU.

The exploitation of the latest CPU architectural extensions, such as the AVX2 and AVX-512 extensions, are the target for these optimizations. Although JIT compilers can provide impressive speedups to GEMM libraries, they expose a new attack surface through the built-in JIT code caches. These software-based caches allow an adversary to extract sensitive information through carefully designed timing attacks. The attack surface of such libraries has become more prominent due to their widespread integration into popular Machine Learning (ML) frameworks such as PyTorch and Tensorflow.In our paper, we present a novel attack strategy for JIT-compiled GEMM libraries called JAXED. We demonstrate how an adversary can exploit the GEMM library’s vulnerable state management to extract confidential CNN model hyperparameters. We show that using JAXED, one can successfully extract the hyperparameters of models with fully-connected layers with an average accuracy of 92%.

To this end, several margin-based (e.g., angular, additive and additive angular margins) softmax loss functions have been proposed to increase the feature margin between different classes. However, despite great achievements have been made, they mainly suffer from four issues: 1) They are based on the assumption of well-cleaned training sets, without considering the consequence of noisy labels inherently existing in most of face recognition datasets; 2) They ignore the importance of informative (e.g., semi-hard) features mining for discriminative learning; 3) They encourage the feature margin only from the perspective of ground truth class, without realizing the discriminability from other non-ground truth classes; and 4) They set the feature margin between different classes to be same and fixed, which may not adapt the situation of unbalanced data in different classes very well. To cope with these issues, this paper develops a novel loss function, which explicitly estimates the noisy labels to drop them and adaptively emphasizes the semi-hard feature vectors from the remaining reliable ones to guide the discriminative feature learning. Thus we can address all the above issues and achieve more discriminative features for face recognition.

Currently, the most significant line of defense against Android malware is anti-malware software products, such as Norton, Lookout, and Comodo Mobile Security, which mainly use the signature-based method to recognize threats. However, malware attackers increasingly employ techniques such as repackaging and obfuscation to bypass signatures and defeat attempts to analyze their inner mechanisms. The increasing sophistication of Android malware calls for new defensive techniques that are harder to evade, and are capable of protecting users against novel threats. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic analysis method named Component Traversal that can automatically execute the code routines of each given Android application (app) as completely as possible. Based on the extracted Linux kernel system calls, we further construct the weighted directed graphs and then apply a deep learning framework resting on the graph based features for newly unknown Android malware detection. A comprehensive experimental study on a real sample collection from Comodo Cloud Security Center is performed to compare various malware detection approaches.

The security guarantees of SSL/TLS are critically dependent on the correct validation of the X.509 server certificates presented during the handshake stage of the SSL/TLS protocol. Hostname verification is a critical component of the certificate validation process that verifies the remote server's identity by checking if the hostname of the server matches any of the names present in the X.509 certificate. Hostname verification is a highly complex process due to the presence of numerous features and corner cases such as wildcards, IP addresses, international domain names, and so forth. Therefore, testing hostname verification implementations present a challenging task. In this paper, we present HVLearn, a novel black-box testing framework for analyzing SSL/TLS hostname verification implementations, which is based on automata learning algorithms. HVLearn utilizes a number of certificate templates, i.e., certificates with a common name (CN) set to a specific pattern, in order to test different rules from the corresponding specification. For each certificate template, HVLearn uses automata learning algorithms to infer a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) that describes the set of all hostnames that match the CN of a given certificate. Once a model is inferred for a certificate template, HVLearn checks the model for bugs by finding discrepancies with the inferred models from other implementations or by checking against regular-expression-based rules derived from the specification. The key insight behind our approach is that the acceptable hostnames for a given certificate template form a regular language. Therefore, we can leverage automata learning techniques to efficiently infer DFA models that accept the corresponding regular language. We use HVLearn to analyze the hostname verification implementations in a number of popular SSL/TLS libraries and applications written in a diverse set of languages like C, Python, and Java. We demonstrate that HVLearn can achieve on average 11.21% higher code coverage than existing black/gray-box fuzzing techniques. By comparing the DFA models inferred by HVLearn, we found 8 unique violations of the RFC specifications in the tested hostname verification implementations. Several of these violations are critical and can render the affected implementations vulnerable to active man-in-the-middle attacks.",2375-1207,978-1-5090-5533-3,10.1109/SP.2017.46,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7958596,,Testing;Servers;IP networks;Learning automata;Security;Protocols;Electronic mail,computer network security;deterministic automata;finite automata;IP networks;learning (artificial intelligence);protocols,HVLearn;automated black-box analysis;hostname verification;SSL/TLS implementation;network communication security protocol;SSL/TLS security guarantee;X.509 server certificate validation;SSL/TLS protocol handshake;remote server identity verification;wildcards;IP address;international domain names;black-box testing framework;automata learning algorithm;common name set;deterministic finite automaton;DFA;regular-expression-based rules;SSL/TLS libraries;C language;Python language;Java language;code coverage;RFC specifications;active man-in-the-middle attack,,36.0,,61.0,IEEE,26 Jun 2017,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,False,True,True,

AIS is a time-slotted protocol that also provides unicast messages-usually employed to manage self-separation and to exchange safety information. However, AIS does not provide any security feature. The messages are exchanged in clear-text, and they are not authenticated, being vulnerable to several attacks, including forging and replay. Despite the existing contributions in the literature propose some strategies to overcome the exposed weaknesses, some are insecure, others do not comply with the standard, while the remaining few ones would introduce an unacceptable overhead-that is, they would require a relevant number of AIS-time slots, because of the limited payload available for each time-slot. In this paper, we propose SecureAIS, a key agreement scheme that allows any pair of vessels in reach of an AIS radio to agree on a shared session key of the desired length, by requiring just a fraction of the AIS time-slots of competing solutions. Further, the scheme is fully standard compliant and does not require any modification to the available hardware. The proposed scheme integrates the Elliptic Curve Qu-Vanstone (ECQV) implicit certification scheme and the Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman (ECDH) key agreement technique, requiring moderate computational overhead while enjoying an optimal usage of the available bandwidth. When configured with the highest security level of 256 bits, SecureAIS allows two AIS transceivers to agree on a shared session key in 20 time-slots, against the 96 time-slots required by the competing solution based on traditional X.509 certificates. The proposed solution has been implemented and tested in a real scenario, while its security has been formally evaluated through the ProVerif tool.

An interesting example of such graphs is control-flow graphs representing possible software code execution flows. As such graphs represent more semantic information of code, developing techniques and tools for such graphs can be highly beneficial for detecting vulnerabilities in software for its reliability. However, existing heterogeneous graph techniques are still insufficient in handling complex graphs where the number of different types of nodes and edges is large and variable. This paper concentrates on the Ethereum smart contracts as a sample of software codes represented by heterogeneous contract graphs built upon both control-flow graphs and call graphs containing different types of nodes and links. We propose MANDO, a new heterogeneous graph representation to learn such heterogeneous contract graphs’ structures. MANDO extracts customized meta-paths, which compose relational connections between different types of nodes and their neighbors. Moreover, it develops a multi-metapath heterogeneous graph attention network to learn multi-level embeddings of different types of nodes and their metapaths in the heterogeneous contract graphs, which can capture the code semantics of smart contracts more accurately and facilitate both fine-grained line-level and coarse-grained contract-level vulnerability detection. Our extensive evaluation of large smart contract datasets shows that MANDO improves the vulnerability detection results of other techniques at the coarse-grained contract level. More importantly, it is the first learning-based approach capable of identifying vulnerabilities at the fine-grained line-level, and significantly improves the traditional code analysis-based vulnerability detection approaches by 11.35% to 70.81% in terms of F1-score.",,978-1-6654-7330-9,10.1109/DSAA54385.2022.10032337,Ministry of Education; ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10032337,heterogeneous graphs;graph embedding;graph neural networks;vulnerability detection;smart contracts;Ethereum blockchain,Codes;Image edge detection;Smart contracts;Semantics;Data science;Software;Software reliability,blockchains;contracts;graph theory;learning (artificial intelligence),coarse-grained contract level;complex graphs;control-flow graphs;Ethereum smart contracts;fine-grained detection;fine-grained line-level;heterogeneous contract graphs;heterogeneous graph representation;heterogeneous graph techniques;heterogeneous graphs;homogeneous graph techniques;MANDO;multilevel embeddings;multilevel heterogeneous graph embeddings;multimetapath heterogeneous graph attention network;possible software code execution;smart contract datasets;smart contract vulnerabilities;software codes;traditional code analysis-based vulnerability detection approaches;vulnerability detection results,,2.0,,34.0,IEEE,8 Feb 2023,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,False,True,True,True

Research has found that IoT malware can spread quickly on devices of different processer architectures, which leads our attention to cross-architecture binary similarity comparison technology. The goal of binary similarity comparison is to determine whether the semantics of two binary snippets is similar. Existing learning-based approaches usually learn the representations of binary code snippets individually and perform similarity matching based on the distance metric, without considering interbinary semantic interactions. Moreover, they often rely on the large-scale external code corpus for instruction embeddings pretraining, which is heavyweight and easy to suffer the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) problem. In this article, we propose an interaction-based cross-architecture IoT binary similarity comparison system, Inter-BIN. Our key insight is to introduce interaction between instruction sequences by co-attention mechanism, which can flexibly perform soft alignment of semantically related instructions from different architectures. And we design a lightweight multifeature fusion-based instruction embedding method, which can avoid the heavy workload and the OOV problem of previous approaches. Extensive experiments show that Inter-BIN can significantly outperform state-of-the-art approaches on cross-architecture binary similarity comparison tasks of different input granularities.

Unfortunately many organizations have ineffective traceability practices in place, largely because of poor communication and time pressure problems. Therefore researchers have proposed various approaches to automatically recover requirement-to-code links. Typically, these approaches are based on Information Retrieval techniques, and use various features such as synonyms, verb-object phrases, and structural information. Although many links are thus recovered, the effectiveness of individual features is not fully evaluated, and it is rather difficult to combine different features to produce better results. In this paper, we implement a tool, called R2C, that combines various features to recover requirement-to-code links.

A critical point has been reached in IoT security in 2016 through a major distributed denial of service attack that disturbed the operation of large Internet service providers and online services, carried out by a new IoT malware named Mirai. The release of its source code online led to the emergence of new malware types and the reemergence of old ones such as Gafgyt who has been around since 2014. In this context, quickly identifying the family of malware enables security professionals to apply suitable countermeasures.

In 2017, more than 468,830 unique mobile ransomware samples were discovered marking a 415 percent year-over-year increase in new ransomware. This trend presents a major concern for mobile users as they increasingly rely on their devices to safeguard sensitive information. Previous solutions have relied on high level bytecode and XML-based permission files to detect malicious applications. Unfortunately, attackers are resorting to obfuscation techniques that involve repackaging apps with malicious content directly in native machine code. As such, the aforementioned methods are insufficient for detecting modern mobile ransomware. To address these concerns, this work evaluates the effectiveness of using native instructions in detecting ransomware. We characterize different machine learning models and demonstrate that opcodes in native instructions can be used for detecting mobile ransomware with near ideal accuracy. In addition, we make the observation that the number of instruction opcodes that contribute to the detection of ransomware is significantly less than the full range of supported opcodes within a contemporary instruction set.

The state-of-the-art Android malware clustering approaches rely heavily on the raw labels from commercial AntiVirus (AV) vendors, which causes misclustering for a substantial number of weakly-labeled malware due to the inconsistent, incomplete and overly generic labels reported by these closed-source AV engines, whose capabilities vary greatly and whose internal mechanisms are opaque (i.e., intermediate detection results are unavailable for clustering). The raw labels are thus often used as the only important source of information for clustering. To address the limitations of the existing approaches, this paper presents Andre, a new ANDroid Hybrid REpresentation Learning approach to clustering weakly-labeled Android malware by preserving heterogeneous information from multiple sources (including the results of static code analysis, the meta-information of an app, and the raw-labels of the AV vendors) to jointly learn a hybrid representation for accurate clustering. The learned representation is then fed into our outlier-aware clustering to partition the weakly-labeled malware into known and unknown families. The malware whose malicious behaviours are close to those of the existing families on the network, are further classified using a three-layer Deep Neural Network (DNN). The unknown malware are clustered using a standard density-based clustering algorithm. We have evaluated our approach using 5,416 ground-truth malware from Drebin and 9,000 malware from VirusShare (uploaded between Mar. 2017 and Feb. 2018), consisting of 3324 weakly-labeled malware.

What drives organizations to seek better methods to protect data? The cost of losing data can be high, and it will get higher. Large organizations are able to withstand the malware onslaught, small and mid-size companies have 50-50 chance of remaining in business. To reduce the damage caused by malware, organizations are investing in technology and research. Current research in supervised machine learning is promising. Small and mid-sized companies do not have security professionals to maintain and monitor them. Another area of research is “Honeypots” and “Red Flags”. These techniques may work in espionage, but “white hat testers” demonstrate that these traps are recognized and avoided. Organizations guilty of a data breach, even with clear evidence of negligence are seldom prosecuted. It is very rare that civil or criminal charges are brought against those negligent of reasonable efforts. Can the current environment change? New technologies will eventually be available for small and mid-sized organizations. Laws are changing to make senior management culpable for negligence in protecting sensitive data. Organizations need another way to protect against a data breach. An alternate, and easier strategy for fighting malware is to write software more difficult to hack. This research is identifying how current software practices, lessons learned from malware software, and a novel method to identify critical code, can reduce successful malware attacks. The objective of the research is to search for and identify critical sections in code that should be modified for reducing vulnerabilities. The critical application logic is identified and alternate designs are implemented making it more difficult for the malware author to locate and modify. This research examines easy processes to learn and apply. The work is applicable for all organization, but the existing focus is on helping small and mid-sized organizations. A goal is to reduce the complexity in designing more secure software. The primary considerations are that there are only small additional burdens on software designers and that management sees business value for supporting and requiring more secure software. Because small and mid-sized organizations are more tightly integrated into the supply chain, it the in the interest of large organization, government agencies and the public that these small and mid-sized organizations create more secure software.

Recently, the vessel segmentation method based on deep learning has achieved outstanding performance. However, vessel segmentation remains challenging due to thin vessels with low contrast that easily lose spatial information in the traditional U-shaped segmentation network. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel and straightforward full-resolution network (FR-UNet) that expands horizontally and vertically through a multiresolution convolution interactive mechanism while retaining full image resolution. In FR-UNet, the feature aggregation module integrates multiscale feature maps from adjacent stages to supplement high-level contextual information. The modified residual blocks continuously learn multiresolution representations to obtain a pixel-level accuracy prediction map. Moreover, we propose the dual-threshold iterative algorithm (DTI) to extract weak vessel pixels for improving vessel connectivity. The proposed method was evaluated on retinal vessel datasets (DRIVE, CHASE_DB1, and STARE) and coronary angiography datasets (DCA1 and CHUAC). The results demonstrate that FR-UNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods by achieving the highest Sen, AUC, F1, and IOU on most of the above-mentioned datasets with fewer parameters, and that DTI enhances vessel connectivity while greatly improving sensitivity.

A Bag-of-Phonetic-Codes Modelfor Cyber-Bullying Detection in Twitter,A. Shekhar; M. Venkatesan,"Department of computer Science & Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Karnataka; Department of Computer Science & Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Karnataka",2018 International Conference on Current Trends towards Converging Technologies (ICCTCT),29 Nov 2018,2018.0,,,1,7,"Social networking sites such as Twitter, Facebook, MySpace, Instagram are emerging as a strong medium of communication these days. These have become a part and parcel of daily life. People can express their thoughts and activities among their social circle with brings them closer to their community. However this freedom of expression has its drawbacks. Sometimes people show their aggression on Social Media which in turn hurts the sentiments of the targeted victims. Certain forms of cyber-bullying are sexual, racial and physical disability based. Hence a proper surveillance is necessary to tackle such situations. Twitter as a micro-blogging site sees cyber abuse on a daily basis. However, tweets are raw texts; containing a lot of misspelled words and censored words. This paper proposes a novel method to detect cyber-bullying, a Bag-of-Phonetic-Codes model. Using pronunciation of words as features can rectify misspelled words and can identify censored words. Correctly identifying duplicate words can lead to smaller vocabulary of words, thereby reducing the feature space. The inspiration for this proposed work is drawn from the famous Bag-of-Words model for extracting textual features. Phonetic code generation has been done using the Soundex Algorithm. Besides the proposed model, experiments were carried out with both supervised and unsupervised machine learning approaches on multiple datasets to understand the approaches and challenges in the domain of cyber-bullying detection.",,978-1-5386-3702-9,10.1109/ICCTCT.2018.8550938,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8550938,Twitter;Sentiment Analysis;Machine Learning;SVM Classifier;Naive Bayes Classifier;LDA Algorithm;K-Means Clustering;Deep Learning,Twitter;Sentiment analysis;Feature extraction;Task analysis;Machine learning;Semantics,feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data;sentiment analysis;social networking (online),social circle;cyber abuse;misspelled words;censored words;duplicate words;Twitter;social media;bag-of-phonetic-codes modelfor cyber-bullying detection;social networking sites;Facebook;MySpace;Instagram;microblogging site;feature space;bag-of-words model;textual features extraction;Soundex algorithm;unsupervised machine learning approaches;supervised machine learning approaches,,9.0,,28.0,IEEE,29 Nov 2018,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,False,True,True,
Smart Contract Based Data Trading Mode Using Blockchain and Machine Learning,W. Xiong; L. Xiong,"Department of Information Management, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China; Department of Information Management, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China",IEEE Access,7 Aug 2019,2019.0,7,,102331,102344,"There are two traditional data trading modes, the hosting mode, and the aggregation mode, which depend on the trusted third parties to a large extent. The hosting mode is that the data are completely hosted in the data trading center, so the data trading center retains the data. On the surface, the aggregation mode is that the data trading center is not to retain the data of trading, but actually, it has the ability to retain the data. There is a fundamental difference between the ability to retain the data and the inability to retain the data. These two trading modes cause the data owners to be afraid to share data trading. In this paper, we propose a solution to the data trading mode based on the smart contract using blockchain and machine learning. Our solution takes advantage of the immutability, tamper-proof and traceability of blockchain, the programmability of smart contract, and the verification of data availability by the similarity learning to propose a challenge response mechanism between the data purchaser and the data owner, an off-chain download mechanism between the data purchaser and the data storage service provider, and an arbitration mechanism for the controversy resolution of the data trading. The challenge response mechanism is used to authenticate and authorize the data owner, the off-chain download mechanism is used to authenticate and authorize the data purchaser to download the purchased data, and the similarity learning is used to deal with the controversy over the data availability in the data trading. The design and implementation of data trading smart contract successfully achieved the goal of removing the trusted third party in the data trading, and thus, the problem that the data trading center has the ability to retain the data in the process of the data trading is solved, as well as the automatic payment by using the Ethereum encrypted currency among the trading participants is realized.

Most of the existing methods try to obtain a consensus structure coefficient matrix based on view-specific subspace recoveries. However, since view-specific structures contain individualized components that are intrinsically different from the consensus structure, directly adopting view-specific subspace structures might not be a reasonable choice. In this paper, with this concern in mind, our goal is to seek novel strategies to extract valuable components from view-specific structures that are consistent with the consensus subspace structure. To this end, we propose a novel multi-view subspace clustering method named split multiplicative multi-view subspace clustering (SM2SC) with the joint strength of a multiplicative decomposition scheme and a variable splitting scheme. Specifically, the multiplicative decomposition scheme effectively guarantees the structural consistency of the extracted components. Then, the variable splitting scheme takes a step further via extracting the structural consistent components from view-specific structures. Furthermore, an alternating optimization algorithm is proposed to optimize the resulting optimization problem, which is non-convex and constrained. We prove that this algorithm could converge to a critical point. Finally, we provide empirical studies on real-world datasets that speak to the practical efficacy of our proposed method.

In this work, we study property inference in scenarios where the adversary can maliciously control a part of the training data (poisoning data) with the goal of increasing the leakage. Previous works on poisoning attacks focused on trying to decrease the accuracy of models. Here, for the first time, we study poisoning attacks where the goal of the adversary is to increase the information leakage of the model. We show that poisoning attacks can boost the information leakage significantly and should be considered as a stronger threat model in sensitive applications where some of the data sources may be malicious.We theoretically prove that our attack can always succeed as long as the learning algorithm used has good generalization properties. Then we experimentally evaluate our on different datasets (Census dataset, Enron email dataset, MNIST and CelebA), properties (that are present in the training data as features, that are not present as features, and properties that are uncorrelated with the rest of the training data or classification task) and model architectures (including Resnet-18 and Resnet-50). We were able to achieve high attack accuracy with relatively low poisoning rate, namely, 2–3% poisoning in most of our experiments.

Traditionally, the black-box attacks are either transfer attacks requiring model stealing, or score/decision-based gradient estimation attacks requiring a large number of queries. In practical scenarios, especially for cloud-based ML services and timing-constrained CPS use-cases, every query incurs a huge cost, thereby rendering state-of-the-art decision-based attacks ineffective in such settings. Towards this, we propose a novel methodology for automatically generating an extremely fast and imperceptible decision-based attack called FaDec. It follows two main steps: (1) fast estimation of the classification boundary by combining the half-interval search-based algorithm with gradient sign estimation to reduce the number of queries; and (2) adversarial noise optimization to ensure the imperceptibility. For illustration, we evaluate FaDec on the image recognition and traffic sign detection using multiple state-of-the-art DNNs trained on CIFAR-10 and the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmarks (GTSRB) datasets.

To improve prediction performance, this paper introduces cross-entropy, one common measure for natural language, as a new code metric into defect prediction tasks and proposes a framework called DefectLearner for this process. We first build a recurrent neural network language model to learn regularities in source code from software repository. Based on the trained model, the cross-entropy of each component can be calculated. To evaluate the discrimination for defect-proneness, cross-entropy is compared with 20 widely used metrics on 12 open-source projects. The experimental results show that cross-entropy metric is more discriminative than 50% of the traditional metrics.

However, most existing methods focus on subtracting feature processing consumption to reduce the parameters and calculations without refining the immediate features, which leads to inadequate information in the restoration. In this paper, we propose a lightweight network termed DDistill-SR, which significantly improves the SR quality by capturing and reusing more helpful information in a static-dynamic feature distillation manner. Specifically, we propose a plug-in reparameterized dynamic unit (RDU) to promote the performance and inference cost trade-off. During the training phase, the RDU learns to linearly combine multiple reparameterizable blocks by analyzing varied input statistics to enhance layer-level representation. In the inference phase, the RDU is equally converted to simple dynamic convolutions that explicitly capture robust dynamic and static feature maps. Then, the information distillation block is constructed by several RDUs to enforce hierarchical refinement and selective fusion of spatial context information. Furthermore, we propose a dynamic distillation fusion (DDF) module to enable dynamic signals aggregation and communication between hierarchical modules to further improve performance. Empirical results show that our DDistill-SR outperforms the baselines and achieves state-of-the-art results on most super-resolution domains with much fewer parameters and less computational overhead.

These fragments are syntax trees that can be compared by using a tree distance function. Tree distance functions are generally very costly. Sequentially calculating the similarities of fragments with them becomes prohibitively expensive. In this paper we experimentally demonstrate how a spatial index can be used to substantially increase matching performance.

While many intrusion detection systems (IDSes) have been adapted to monitor ICS, they cannot detect malicious network packets from a compromised PLC that con-form to the network protocol. A domain expert needs to manually construct IDS rules to model a PLC’s behavior. That approach is time-consuming and error-prone. Alternatively, machine learning can infer a PLC’s behavior model from network traces, but that model may be inaccurate due to a lack of high-quality training data. This paper presents CoToRu - a toolchain that takes in the PLC’s code to automatically generate a comprehensive set of IDS rules. CoToRu comprises (1) an analyzer that parses PLC code to build a state transition table for modeling the PLC’s behavior, and (2) a generator that instantiates IDS rules for detecting deviations in PLC behavior. The generated rules can be imported into Zeek IDS to detect various attacks. We apply CoToRu to a power grid testbed and show that our generated rules provide superior performance compared to existing IDSes, including those based on statistical analysis, invariant-checking, and machine learning.

However, increased use of sensitive business and private personal data with no or limited privacy safeguards has raised great concerns among individuals and government regulators. To address the growing tension between the need for data utility and the demand for data privacy, trusted execution environment (TEE) is being used in academic research as well as industrial application as a powerful primitive to enable confidential computation on the private data with only the result disclosed but not the original private data. While much of the current research has been focusing on protecting the TEE against attacks (e.g. side-channel information leakage), the security and privacy of the applications executing inside a TEE enclave has received little attention. The general attitude is that the application is running inside a trusted computing base (TCB), and therefore can be trusted. This assumption may not be valid when it comes to unverified third-party applications. In this paper, we present PrivacyScope, a static code analyzer designed to detect leakage of private data by an application code running in a TEE. PrivacyScope accomplishes this by analyzing the application code and identifying violations of a property called nonreversibility. We introduce nonreversibility since the classical noninterference property falls short of detecting private data leakage in certain scenarios, e.g., in machine learning (ML) programs where the program output is always related to (private) input data. Given its strict reliance on observable state, the noninterference falls short of detecting private data leakage in these situations. By design, PrivacyScope detects both explicit and implicit information leakage. The nonreversibility property is formally defined based on the noninterference property. Additionally, we describe the algorithms for PrivacyScope as extensions to the runtime semantics of a general language. To evaluate the efficacy of our approach and proof-of-feasibility prototype, we apply PrivacyScope to detect data leakage in select open-source ML code modules including linear regression, k-means clustering and collaborative filtering. Also, PrivacyScope can detect intentional data leakage code injected by a programmer.

At present, homology identification still relies on manual analysis and security experts' experience in the anti-malware industry. In addition, research on large-scale malicious code automated homology analysis is still insufficient. The method proposed in this paper is to solve the problem of large-scale malicious code homology automatic analysis, and hope to provide auxiliary information for discovering the group behind the APT attack. In this paper, we collected samples of different APT groups from public threat intelligence and proposed a novel approach to classify these samples into different APT groups to further analyze the homology of malware. We combined the CFG (Control Flow Graph) of the malicious code function and the disassembled code of the stripped malware to generate the embedding, i.e., a numeric vector, which formed a function feature database of the APT group, and presented a neural network model used for APT group classification. We have implemented our approach in a prototype system called MCrab. Our extensive evaluation showed that MCrab could produce high accuracy results, with few to no false positives. Our research also showed that deep learning can be successfully applied to malware homology analysis.",,978-1-7281-0273-3,10.1109/ICT.2019.8798769,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8798769,CFG;Malware Homology Analysis;APT group;Deep Learning,,flow graphs;invasive software;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;pattern classification,large-scale malicious code homology automatic analysis;malicious code function;disassembled code;APT group classification;malware homology analysis;functions-based CFG embedding;homology identification;APT attacks;antimalware industry;advanced persistent threat;neural network model;MCrab;deep learning,,5.0,,35.0,IEEE,15 Aug 2019,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,False,True,True,

However, the adoption of these tools is hindered by their high false positive rates. If the false positive rate is too high, developers may get acclimated to violation reports from these tools, causing concrete and severe bugs being overlooked. Fortunately, some violations are actually addressed and resolved by developers. We claim that those violations that are recurrently fixed are likely to be true positives, and an automated approach can learn to repair similar unseen violations. However, there is lack of a systematic way to investigate the distributions on existing violations and fixed ones in the wild, that can provide insights into prioritizing violations for developers, and an effective way to mine code and fix patterns which can help developers easily understand the reasons of leading violations and how to fix them. In this paper, we first collect and track a large number of fixed and unfixed violations across revisions of software. The empirical analyses reveal that there are discrepancies in the distributions of violations that are detected and those that are fixed, in terms of occurrences, spread and categories, which can provide insights into prioritizing violations. To automatically identify patterns in violations and their fixes, we propose an approach that utilizes convolutional neural networks to learn features and clustering to regroup similar instances. We then evaluate the usefulness of the identified fix patterns by applying them to unfixed violations. The results show that developers will accept and merge a majority (69/116) of fixes generated from the inferred fix patterns.

Interestingly, randomization has also been proposed to improve security of learning algorithms against evasion attacks, as it results in hiding information about the classifier to the attacker. Recent work has proposed game-theoretical formulations to learn secure classifiers, by simulating different evasion attacks and modifying the classification function accordingly. However, both the classification function and the simulated data manipulations have been modeled in a deterministic manner, without accounting for any form of randomization. In this paper, we overcome this limitation by proposing a randomized prediction game, namely, a noncooperative game-theoretic formulation in which the classifier and the attacker make randomized strategy selections according to some probability distribution defined over the respective strategy set.

As far as critical decision-making can be based upon the results of RSI analysis, it is important to clearly identify and understand potential security threats occurring in those machine learning algorithms. Notably, it has recently been found that neural networks are particularly sensitive to carefully designed attacks, generally crafted given the full knowledge of the considered deep network.

However, an attack can be initiated by simply copying the 2D barcode and attaching it to a counterfeit product. In this paper, we aim at proposing an authentication scheme with a mobile imaging device for a 2D barcode. This work presents a competitive solution among the 2D barcode authentication schemes that have been verified under mobile imaging conditions. The proposed copy-proof scheme is composed of two sets of features which are extracted by exploiting the characteristics of barcoding channel models. The proposed features identify the intrinsic differences between genuine and counterfeit barcode images in the frequency and spatial domains. An efficient two-stage barcode authentication framework is then proposed by combining the two sets of features in a cascading manner. To evaluate the practicality of the proposed authentication scheme, four databases with different devices (printers, scanners, mobile cameras), barcode sizes, and barcode designs are considered in the experiments.

The distributed computing system combined with coding is referred to as coded computation. For a matrix multiplication, we consider a variation of coded computation that ensures the master's privacy from the workers, which is referred to as private coded matrix multiplication. In the private coded matrix multiplication, the master needs to compute a matrix multiplication on its own matrix and one of the matrices in a library exclusively shared by the external workers. After the master recovers the matrix multiplication through coded matrix multiplication, the workers should not know which matrix in the library was desired by the master, which implies that the master's privacy is ensured. Our problem is a special case of linear private computation, where a linear combination of matrices in the library should be concealed.

However, most existing methods generate neural program embeddings di-rectly from the program source codes, by learning from features such as tokens, abstract syntax trees, and control flow graphs. This paper takes a fresh look at how to improve program embed-dings by leveraging compiler intermediate representation (IR). We first demonstrate simple yet highly effective methods for enhancing embedding quality by training embedding models alongside source code and LLVM IR generated by default optimization levels (e.g., -02). We then introduce IRGEN, a framework based on genetic algorithms (GA), to identify (near-)optimal sequences of optimization flags that can significantly improve embedding quality. We use IRGEN to find optimal sequences of LLVM optimization flags by performing GA on source code datasets. We then extend a popular code embedding model, CodeCMR, by adding a new objective based on triplet loss to enable a joint learning over source code and LLVM IR. We benchmark the quality of embedding using a rep-resentative downstream application, code clone detection. When CodeCMR was trained with source code and LLVM IRs optimized by findings of IRGEN, the embedding quality was significantly im-proved, outperforming the state-of-the-art model, CodeBERT, which was trained only with source code. Our augmented CodeCMR also outperformed CodeCMR trained over source code and IR optimized with default optimization levels. We investigate the properties of optimization flags that increase embedding quality, demonstrate IRGEN's generalization in boosting other embedding models, and establish IRGEN's use in settings with extremely limited training data.

For example, if the extracted features for a ""bird"" image are wheel, saddle and frame, the model may be under attack. UnMask detects such attacks and defends the model by rectifying the misclassification, re-classifying the image based on its robust features. Our extensive evaluation shows that UnMask detects up to 96.75% of attacks, and defends the model by correctly classifying up to 93% of adversarial images produced by the current strongest attack, Projected Gradient Descent, in the gray-box setting.

Authorship identification can be used in a wide range of software domains, e.g., code authorship disputes, plagiarism detection, exposure of attackers’ identity. Besides the inherent challenges from legacy software development, framework programming and crowdsourcing mode in Android raise the difficulties of authorship identification significantly. More specifically, widespread third party libraries and inherited components (e.g., classes, methods, and variables) dilute the primary code within the entire Android app and blur the boundaries of code written by different authors. However, prior research has not well addressed these challenges.To this end, we design a two-phased approach to attribute the primary code of an Android app to the specific developer. In the first phase, we put forward three types of strategies to identify the relationships between Java packages in an app, which consist of context, semantic and structural relationships. A package aggregation algorithm is developed to cluster all packages that are of high probability written by the same authors. In the second phase, we develop three types of features to capture authors’ coding habits and code stylometry. Based on that, we generate fingerprints for an author from its developed Android apps and employ several machine learning algorithms for authorship classification.

This increasing complexity gives rise to a new class of attacks which uses software code and targets hardware vulnerabilities of the system microarchitectures. Software attacks targeting hardware vulnerabilities (SATHVs) gain popularity. In particular, cache side channel attacks, Spectre, and Rowhammer are serious threats. They take advantage of microarchitectural vulnerabilities to extract secret information or harm the system. As these attacks target the system’s hardware, they can avoid traditional software antivirus protections. However, they modify the normal operation of the system’s hardware. Hardware Performance Counters (HPCs) are special registers that allow counting specific hardware events. These registers can help us monitor system’s execution at hardware level and detect this set of attacks. Many solutions in the literature use HPCs to detect SATHVs. Although, these solutions target detecting only a limited set of the available SATHVs.

However, standard Predictive Maintenance approaches assume the availability of sensor measurements, and the costs associated with adding sensors or remotely accessing sensor readings may discourage the development of such technologies. In this context, Alarm Forecasting can be very useful as it represents a low-cost alternative or helpful support to sensor-based Predictive Maintenance. In this work, we propose a new formulation for the Alarm Forecasting problem, framed as a multi-label classification task. We present a novel deep learning-based approach called FORMULA (alarm FORecasting in MUlti-LAbel setting). FORMULA leverages Transformer, a popular Neural Network architecture in the field of Natural Language Processing. To cope with alarm imbalance, we draw inspiration from Segmentation and Object Detection. Thus, FORMULA is trained by minimizing the Weighted Focal Loss, which turns out to be very effective in predicting rare alarms. These alarms, even if they are difficult to predict by nature, often are business-critical. We assess the proposed approach on a representative real-world problem from the packaging industry. In particular, we show that it outperforms not only classic multilabel techniques but also models based on recurrent neural networks. As regards the latter, the proposed approach also exhibits a lower computational burden, both in terms of training time and model size. To foster research in the field and reproducibility, we also publicly share the alarm logs dataset and the code used to perform the experiments. Note to Practitioners—This paper was motivated by the problem of monitoring equipment in the scenario of dairy products packaging, under the mild assumption that logs of the alarm generated by the packaging machines are available. This paper proposes an alarm forecasting algorithm. Its goal is to predict if any alarm will occur in the future, based only on past alarm logs. The limits of the considered future window can be defined arbitrarily, so there is enough time to perform corrective actions. Thus, the proposed approach aims to prevent unexpected downtime that would not only hinder productivity but also imply significant material waste. The proposed approach leverages methodologies from Natural Language Processing and Object Detection to deal with rare alarms that are often very informative in the industrial scenario. Besides, both the code and the real-world industrial datasets used to evaluate the methodology are available publicly. Currently, the proposed approach only uses alarm logs. Especially in the context of Industry 4.0, where many sensory data may be available, this is a limitation. Thus, the described approach might be extended by integrating alarm logs with sensory data. This integration is expected to improve the estimation of equipment health state. The results described in this paper may find application not only in the manufacturing sector but also in different areas such as Cyber Security, where log files keep activity records of each process performed.",1558-3783,,10.1109/TASE.2021.3127995,"Regione Veneto Project VIrtualization and Remotization for Resilient and Efficient Manufacturing, Virtualizzazione e remotizzazione per una manifattura efficiente e resiliente (VIR2EM); Italian Minister for Education (MIUR) through the initiative “Departments of Excellence” (Law 232/2016); Statwolf Data Science;",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9627935,Alarm forecasting;deep learning;imbalanced classification;industrial IoT;Industry 40;multi-label classification;predictive maintenance,Forecasting;Predictive models;Codes;Monitoring;Deep learning;Task analysis;Predictive maintenance,condition monitoring;data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);maintenance engineering;natural language processing;neural nets;object detection;pattern classification;production engineering computing;recurrent neural nets,rare alarms predictions;Predictive Maintenance technologies;Industrial Equipment producers;customized maintenance plans;standard Predictive Maintenance approaches;sensor measurements;adding sensors;sensor readings;Alarm Forecasting problem;multilabel classification task;deep learning-based approach;MUltiLAbel setting;FORMULA leverages Transformer;popular Neural Network architecture;Natural Language Processing;alarm imbalance;packaging industry;alarm logs;alarm forecasting algorithm;approach leverages methodologies;real-world industrial datasets,,1.0,,45.0,IEEE,29 Nov 2021,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals,False,True,True,

Recently, adversarial attack has been applied to visual object tracking to evaluate the robustness of deep trackers. Assuming that the model structures of deep trackers are known, a variety of white-box attack approaches to visual tracking have demonstrated promising results. However, the model knowledge about deep trackers is usually unavailable in real applications. In this paper, we propose a decision-based black-box attack method for visual object tracking. In contrast to existing black-box adversarial attack methods that deal with static images for image classification, we propose IoU attack that sequentially generates perturbations based on the predicted IoU scores from both current and historical frames. By decreasing the IoU scores, the proposed attack method degrades the accuracy of temporal coherent bounding boxes (i.e., object motions) accordingly. In addition, we transfer the learned perturbations to the next few frames to initialize temporal motion attack. We validate the proposed IoU attack on state-of-the-art deep trackers (i.e., detection based, correlation filter based, and long-term trackers).

However, ways of ensemble attack are rather less investigated, and existing ensemble attacks simply fuse the outputs of all the models evenly. In this work, we treat the iterative ensemble attack as a stochastic gradient descent optimization process, in which the variance of the gradients on different models may lead to poor local optima. To this end, we propose a novel attack method called the stochastic variance reduced ensemble (SVRE) attack, which could reduce the gradient variance of the ensemble models and take full advantage of the ensemble attack. Empirical results on the standard ImageNet dataset demonstrate that the proposed method could boost the adversarial transferability and outperforms existing ensemble attacks significantly.

To overcome the above limitations, we propose an automatic security property generation method (ASPG) by feature analysis and property matching techniques. Machine learning is applied to systematically training the property library from the suspicious behaviors in unknown designs, which is expected to counter with the future HT. To reduce the computational complexity, we transform the register-transfer level (RTL) code into an introduced succinct abstract format to remove the redundant information which is unnecessary for depicting HT features.

A novel vertical handoff decision algorithm in heterogeneous wireless networks,Qing He,"College of lnformation Science and Technology, Donghua Uinversity, Shanghai, China","2010 IEEE International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Information Security",9 Aug 2010,2010.0,,,566,570,"Next generation wireless communications will integrate multiple wireless access networks, including WLAN and WWAN. Vertical handoff decision plays an important role in heterogeneous networks. In this paper, we propose a vertical handoff decision algorithm (VHDA) to provide ubiquitous access at any time. We consider received signal strength (RSS), available network bandwidth (B), monetary cost (C) and user preference (PF) as the vertical handoff decision criteria. Handoffs are divided into two classes: handoffs initiated by mobile nodes (MNs) and handoffs initiated by attachment points (e.g., base stations or access points). Our proposed algorithm consists of two parts: fuzzy logic based VHDA and cost function based VHDA. For the handoffs initiated by MNs, fuzzy logic based VHDA is used to evaluate the performance of the network and make handoff decisions to choose the most appropriate network. For the handoffs initiated by attachment points, cost function based VHDA is utilized to select the MNs with lower cost values. Then the selected MNs are handed over to relieve heavy load of the current network. A performance evaluation using the integration of WLAN and TD-SCDMA as an example shows that fuzzy logic based VHDA is able to make accurate handoff decisions, reduce unnecessary handoffs and eliminate the ping-pong effect. Cost function based VHDA can make selections quickly, balance the network resources and decrease the probability of call blocking and dropping.",,978-1-4244-5849-3,10.1109/WCINS.2010.5544150,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5544150,vertical handoff;heterogeneous networks;WLAN;TD-SCDMA,Wireless networks;Wireless LAN;Time division synchronous code division multiple access;Cost function;Bandwidth;Fuzzy logic;Wireless communication;Artificial intelligence;Land mobile radio cellular systems;Helium,,,,4.0,,12.0,IEEE,9 Aug 2010,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,True,True,True,

Therefore, there are less inspected modules when inspecting the top 20% LOC via CBS+ and EASC. Although the two methods achieve the high Precision@20% value, the Recall@20% and PofB@20% (Proportion of the found Bugs when inspecting the top 20% LOC) values of the two methods are low.

Auto-unpacked contains self-decryption algorithms, where the script codes help quickly decipher script bodies for further analysis. Heuristic analysis is designed to analyze disassemble code contain within a suspicious program. The disassemble code of the suspicious file is compared with a known virus signature database. If the disassemble code matches with the code of the database signature, the file is flagged. The emulator is design to scans code, imitates the way they are executing, and monitoring their actions, preventing any actual damage from being dealt to the computer system or user data. Verdicts on whether or not a program poses a threat are issued based on the results of behaviour analyses.

Thus one of the key challenges in Visual Dialogue task is to learn a more comprehensive and semantic-rich image representation that can adaptively attend to the visual content referred by variant questions. In this paper, we first propose a novel scheme to depict an image from both visual and semantic views. Specifically, the visual view aims to capture the appearance-level information in an image, including objects and their visual relationships, while the semantic view enables the agent to understand high-level visual semantics from the whole image to the local regions. Furthermore, on top of such dual-view image representations, we propose a Dual Encoding Visual Dialogue (DualVD) module, which is able to adaptively select question-relevant information from the visual and semantic views in a hierarchical mode. To demonstrate the effectiveness of DualVD, we propose two novel visual dialogue models by applying it to the Late Fusion framework and Memory Network framework. The proposed models achieve state-of-the-art results on three benchmark datasets. A critical advantage of the DualVD module lies in its interpretability.

Currently, the existing FHE schemes are constructed using lattice-based cryptography. In state-of-the-art algorithms, a huge amount of computational resources are required for homomorphic multiplications and the corresponding bootstrapping that is necessary to refresh the ciphertext for a larger number of operations. Therefore, it is necessary to discover a new innovative approach for FHE that can reduce the computational complexity for practical applications. In this paper, we propose a code-based homomorphic operation scheme. Linear codes are closed under the addition, however, achieving multiplicative homomorphic operations with linear codes has been impossible until now. We strive to solve this problem by proposing a fully homomorphic code scheme that can support both addition and multiplication simultaneously using the Reed-Muller (RM) codes. This can be considered as a preceding step for constructing code-based FHE schemes. As the order of RM codes increases after multiplication, a bootstrapping technique is required to reduce the order of intermediate RM codes to accomplish a large number of operations.

Daugman's approach maps the filter output to a binary iris code. The fractional Hamming distance between two iris codes is computed and decisions about the identity of a person are based on the computed distance. The fractional Hamming distance weights all bits in an iris code equally. However, not all the bits in an iris code are equally useful. Our research is the first to present experiments documenting that some bits are more consistent than others. Different regions of the iris are compared to evaluate their relative consistency, and contrary to some previous research, we find that the middle bands of the iris are more consistent than the inner bands. The inconsistent-bit phenomenon is evident across genders and different filter types.

Researchers have worked at untangling existing commits, i.e., finding which part of a commit relates to which task. In this paper, we contribute to this line of work in two ways: (1) A publicly available dataset of untangled code changes, created with the help of two developers who accurately split their code changes into self contained tasks over a period of four months; (2) a novel approach, EpiceaUntangler, to help developers share untangled commits (aka. atomic commits) by using fine-grained code change information.

Several detection methods are to build run-time environments that allow JavaScript code to run and track its behavior while it runs. Dynamic analysis requires too much time to examine all the web pages a client accesses. Hence, lightweight filtering methods to detect unseen malicious JavaScript snippets are required. Static analysis often extracts statistical and lexical features from the associated JavaScript code of each web page in order to build detection models. In general, static analysis imposes no runtime overhead. These methods are, however, vulnerable to code obfuscation techniques. Some researchers attempt to detect obfuscated VBA macros with Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. In these methods, neural networks extract the features automatically in contrast with traditional approaches. In addition, since several methods are evaluated with a balanced dataset, the practical performance is still open to discussion. To evaluate the practical performance, these methods have to be evaluated with imbalanced datasets.

Recently, deep learning-based methods using HTML as input have achieved significant detection performance improvement.

However, CNN and RNN typically can only extract local features in the HTML code sequences while failing to model the long-range semantics that is crucial for phishing detection.

Then we adopt GNN to model the long-range relations between nodes based on these local features and the graph structure.

Legacy detection of malware has been highly reliant on static signatures, so malware authors have evolved code polymorphic techniques to counteract these tools, thus rendering static malware detectors ineffective. While malware writers may easily use code rewriting techniques to scramble binary images; malware processes at runtime still must conduct a sequence of operational steps to achieve its design goal, indicating an approach based on behavioral analysis where the captured invariants form a new type of forensic fingerprint. Moreover these operational steps are constrained to occur within the computers' or mobile devices' abstract system interface - a finite basis of activities that submit to effective monitoring with a variety of tools. In this work, we propose a formalism for expressing these behaviors, learning them and analyzing them to form automated malware analysis tools. Thus motivated by a need to detect and classify malware, we root its foundation in formal verification, as well as methodology from statistical and machine learning. Specifically using trace data from malware we leverage formal verification methods (such as probabilistic model checking) to construct classifiers and evaluate their efficacy in supervised learning and cross-fold validation experiments.

When embedding binary code into matrix by neural network, the problem of feature representation also needs to be solved in vulnerability detection. However, most of the current researches extract the syntax or structural features of binary code, and take basic block as the minimum analysis unit, which is relatively coarse. In addition, the structural features of binary functions are usually represented by the dependency graph. In the embedding process, only the neighbour information of the node can be obtained, ignoring the global information of the graph. To solve these two problems, we propose a two-channel feature extraction method to obtain semantic feature in finer granularity and represent the structural features globally instead of locally. Inspired by natural language process, we propose a contextual semantic feature extraction method to obtain different granularity features of binary functions. It takes instruction as the minimum analysis unit and obtains the semantic relationship between instructions. Meanwhile, in order to represent the structural feature of each function, we propose a neural GAE model instead of the widely used structure2vec model. In this way, we can preserve and reconstruct the control dependencies between the basic blocks in the whole graph. We have implemented a prototype system BEDetector, evaluated the effectiveness of its neural model and compared the accuracy of vulnerability function detection with state-of-the-art system.

However, current binarized attributed network embedding methods are scarce and mostly ignore the local attribute similarity between each pair of nodes. Besides, none of them attempt to control the independency of each dimension(bit) of the learned binary representation vectors. As existing methods still need improving, we propose an unsupervised Neural-based Binarized Attributed Network Embedding (NBANE) approach. Firstly, we inherit the Weisfeiler-Lehman proximity matrix from predecessors to aggregate high-order features for each node. Secondly, we feed the aggregated features into an autoencoder with the attribute similarity penalizing term and the orthogonality term to make further dimension reduction. To solve the problem of integer optimization we adopt the relaxation-quantization method during the process of training neural networks. Empirically, we evaluate the performance of NBANE through node classification and clustering tasks on three real-world datasets and study a case on fast retrieval in academic networks.

Comparing DSP realizations of correlator and SVM receivers for chaos-based multi-user DS-SS,R. Vali; J. W. H. Kao,"Department of Computing, Unitec Institute of Technology, New Zealand; Ansaldo STS, Taiwan",2014 19th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing,18 Sep 2014,2014.0,,,464,468,This contribution presents a comparison between two realizations of chaos-based multi-user direct-sequence spread spectrum (DS-SS) system in digital signal processor (DSP) technology. The first realization is a conventional correlator receiver and the second is a new support vector machine (SVM) receiver. The two realizations were aimed at examining the tradeoffs between the two receiver types and their suitability for implementation in large scale wireless communication networks. The performance benchmarks used are the bit-error-rate (BER) and system speed. In both systems the information is spread using chaotic sequences resulting in physical layer security in the time and frequency domains. The hardware platform chosen was a 32-bit floating-point TigerSHARC DSP which proved to be sufficient for the representation of chaos-based spreading codes. Both implementations show excellent agreement with the previous theoretical findings in terms of BER performance. This agreement of results proves that the finite number resolution of the DSP does not have a significant effect on the system performance. Overall it is shown that the SVM receiver outperforms the correlator receiver in terms of the BER. However this improvement is at the expense of the processing speed.,2165-3577,978-1-4799-4612-9,10.1109/ICDSP.2014.6900708,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6900708,DSP realization;Chaos-based DS-SS systems;machine learning;physical level security;support vector machine;BER performance,Receivers;Support vector machines;Digital signal processing;Chaotic communication;Training;Bit error rate,chaos;code division multiple access;correlators;digital signal processing chips;electronic engineering computing;floating point arithmetic;radio receivers;spread spectrum communication;support vector machines;telecommunication computing,SVM receiver;chaos based multiuser DS-SS;direct sequence spread spectrum system;digital signal processor technology;correlator receiver;support vector machine receiver;wireless communication;bit error rate;system speed;chaotic sequence;physical layer security;floating point DSP;TigerSHARC DSP,,,,10.0,IEEE,18 Sep 2014,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,False,True,True,

TEM signals received by coils will be disturbed by complex noises. Compared with traditional filtering-based methods, deep-learning-based TEM signal denoising methods achieved impressive denoising performance. However, the existing deep-learning-based methods rely heavily on simulated noise with a certain distribution to construct paired datasets for supervised learning. In real scenarios, if the noise distribution of acquired TEM signals has a huge difference (e.g., the type of noise distribution, the level of noise) with that of the simulated datasets, the trained model may not always be valid. To address this issue, a novel noise-learning-inspired deep denoising network (namely, TEM-NLnet) is proposed for TEM signal denoising. Specifically, instead of inserting the simulated noise, we first learn the noise appeared in real-world signals through generative adversarial networks (GANs), such that the generator can produce the learned noise to construct paired datasets for training. Then, a deep-neural-network-based denoiser is imposed to learn mapping from the noise TEM signal to the corresponding noise-free one. Extensive experiments on the simulated and actual geological datasets show that compared with other state-of-the-art TEM denoising methods, our proposed method achieves better performance in terms of quantitative and visual results.

The problem is NP-hard and can be solved optimally by searching the shortest path on the decision tree. Unfortunately, the existing optimal search algorithms often involve prohibitively high complexities, which indicates that they are infeasible in large-scale MIMO systems. To address this issue, we propose a general heuristic search algorithm, namely, hyper-accelerated tree search (HATS) algorithm. The proposed algorithm employs a deep neural network (DNN) to estimate the optimal heuristic, and then use the estimated heuristic to speed up the underlying memory-bounded search algorithm. This idea is inspired by the fact that the underlying heuristic search algorithm reaches the optimal efficiency with the optimal heuristic function. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm reaches almost the optimal bit error rate (BER) performance in large-scale systems, while the memory size can be bounded. In the meanwhile, it visits nearly the fewest tree nodes.

However, the dramatic increase of Android malicious applications (malapps) has caused serious software failures to Android system and posed a great threat to users. The effective detection of Android malapps has thus become an emerging yet crucial issue. Characterizing the behaviors of Android applications (apps) is essential to detecting malapps. Most existing works on detecting Android malapps were mainly based on string static features, such as permissions and API usage extracted from apps. There also exists work on the detection of Android malapps with structural features, such as control flow graph and data flow graph. As Android malapps have become increasingly polymorphic and sophisticated, using only one type of static features may result in false negatives. In this paper, we propose DroidEnsemble that takes advantages of both string features and structural features to systematically and comprehensively characterize the static behaviors of Android apps and thus build a more accurate detection model for the detection of Android malapps. We extract each app’s string features, including permissions, hardware features, filter intents, restricted API calls, used permissions, code patterns, as well as structural features like function call graph. We then use three machine learning algorithms, namely, support vector machine, k-nearest neighbor, and random forest, to evaluate the performance of these two types of features and of their ensemble. In the experiments, we evaluate our methods and models with 1386 benign apps and 1296 malapps. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of DroidEnsemble. It achieves the detection accuracy as 95.8% with only string features and as 90.68% with only structural features.

The goal is to understand how successful automatic perturbations can be used to avoid detection. In order to reach this goal, we take portable executable malware and add a number of small random injections to evade detection without affecting the malware structure. Our experiments proved that only six perturbations are required to create new functional malware samples exhibiting exactly the same behavior yet with up to 80% less detections based on original malware that was previously detected.

It is difficult to use traditional intrusion detection methods to effectively detect unknown intrusion types. To solve this difficulty, in this paper, a zero-shot intrusion detection method based on regression model is proposed to identify unknown intrusion types in order to provide guarantee for computer security. The method includes firstly taking the data in the normal state and the known intrusion type state as the training set. If the features are non-numeric, one-hot code is used to convert the non-numeric features into numerical features. In addition, in order to overcome the shortage of small data volume of some intrusion types, A Markov model based on exponential smoothing method is proposed. According to the numerical value of the features in the training set, the regression equation was fitted for each state category. Using the numerical value of the features in the training set, the threshold value corresponding to each state category is calculated. For a specific state to be tested in the test set, the regression equation of each state category is substituted successively, and the calculated results are judged to meet the threshold requirements, so as to recognize which state it belongs to: normal state, known invasion state or unknown invasion state.

However, they could introduce security risks as well. Many TPL detection methods have been proposed to detect TPL reuse in Android bytecode or in source code. This paper focuses on detecting TPL reuse in binary code, which is a more challenging task. For a detection target in binary form, libraries may be compiled and linked to separate dynamic-link files or built into a fused binary that contains multiple libraries and project-specific code. This could result in fewer available code features and lower the effectiveness of feature engineering. In this paper, we propose a binary TPL reuse detection framework, LibDB, which can effectively and efficiently detect imported TPLs even in stripped and fused binaries. In addition to the basic and coarse-grained features (string literals and exported function names), LibDB utilizes function contents as a new type of feature. It embeds all functions in a binary file to low-dimensional representations with a trained neural network. It further adopts a function call graph-based comparison method to improve the accuracy of the detection. LibDB is able to support version identification of TPLs contained in the detection target, which is not considered by existing detection methods. To evaluate the performance of LibDB, we construct three datasets for binary-based TPL reuse detection.

We assume a black-box scenario where the adversary has access to only the feature set, and the final hard-decision output of the classifier.

Our final aim is to improve the robustness of the classifier by considering generated examples in rebuilding the classifier. We evaluate our method for the application of static malware detection in portable executable (PE) files. We consider API calls of PE files as their distinguishing features where the feature vector is a binary vector representing the presence-absence of API calls. In our method, we first create a dataset of benign samples by querying the target classifier. We next construct a code table of frequent patterns for the compression of this dataset using the MDL principle. We finally generate an adversarial example corresponding to a malware sample by selecting and adding a pattern from the benign code table to the malware sample. The selected pattern is the one that minimizes the length of the compressed adversarial example given the benign code table. This modification preserves the functionalities of the original malware sample as all original API calls are kept, and only some new API calls are added. Considering a neural network, we show that the evasion rate is 78.24 percent for adversarial examples compared to 8.16 percent for original malware samples.

Conventional 2FA systems require extra interaction like typing a verification code, which is not very user-friendly. For improved user experience, recent work aims at zero-effort 2FA, in which a smart phone placed close to a computer (where the user enters her username/password into a browser to log into a server) automatically assists with the authentication. To prove her possession of the smart phone, the user needs to prove the phone is on the login spot, which reduces zero-effort 2FA to co-presence detection. In this paper, we propose SoundAuth, a secure zero-effort 2FA mechanism based on (two kinds of) ambient audio signals. SoundAuth looks for signs of proximity by having the browser and the smart phone compare both their surrounding sounds and certain unpredictable near-ultrasounds; if significant distinguishability is found, SoundAuth rejects the login request. For the ambient signals comparison, we regard it as a classification problem and employ a machine learning technique to analyze the audio signals.

Arbiter-based physical unclonable function (A-PUF) has been widely regarded as a suitable lightweight security primitive for FPGA bitstream encryption and device authentication. Unfortunately, the metastability of flip-flop gives rise to poor A-PUF reliability in FPGA implementation. Its linear additive path delays are also vulnerable to modeling attacks. Most reliability enhancement techniques tend to increase the response predictability and ease machine learning attacks. This paper presents a robust device authentication method based on the FPGA implementation of a reliability enhanced A-PUF with trinary digit (trit) quadruple responses. A two flip-flop arbiter is used to produce a trit for metastability detection. By considering the ordered responses to all four combinations of first and last challenge bits, each quadruple response can be compressed into a quadbit that represents one of the five classes of trit quadruple response with greater reproducibility. This challenge-response quadruple classification not only greatly reduces the burden of error correction at the device but also enables a precise A-PUF model to be built at the server without having to store the complete challenge-response pair (CRP) set for authentication. Besides, the real challenge to the A-PUF is generated internally by a lossy, nonlinear, and irreversible maximum length signature generator at both the server and device sides to prevent the naked CRP from being machine learned by the attacker. The A-PUF with short repetition code of length five has been tested to achieve a reliability of 1.0 over the full operating temperature range of the target FPGA board with lower hardware resource utilization than other modeling attack resilient strong PUFs. The proposed authentication protocol has also been experimentally evaluated to be practically secure against various machine learning attacks including evolutionary strategy covariance matrix adaptation.",1556-6021,,10.1109/TIFS.2018.2870835,Singapore Ministry of Education Academic Research Fund (AcRF) Tier II(grant numbers:MOE 2015-T2-2-013);,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8466897,Arbiter PUF;reliability enhancement;machine learning attack resistance;authentication protocol,Field programmable gate arrays;Reliability;Authentication;Hardware;Servers;Machine learning;Resistance,circuit reliability;cryptographic protocols;cryptography;field programmable gate arrays;flip-flops;learning (artificial intelligence),reliability enhancement techniques;response predictability;robust device authentication method;FPGA implementation;trinary digit quadruple responses;flip-flop arbiter;trit quadruple response;challenge-response quadruple classification;A-PUF model;lossy length signature generator;irreversible maximum length signature generator;authentication protocol;arbiter PUF;trinary quadruple response;field programmable gate array;malicious hardware infiltration;counterfeit hardware infiltration;arbiter-based physical unclonable function;FPGA bitstream encryption;A-PUF reliability;linear additive path delays;machine learning attacks;FPGA board;attack resistant authentication;reliability enhanced A-PUF;complete challenge-response pair set;nonlinear length signature generator,,61.0,,60.0,IEEE,16 Sep 2018,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals,False,True,True,

Second, they generally ignore the complex disturbance within the background, which reduces the efficiency of the low-rank assumption.

While the most recent artificial deep neural networks (for ex-ample BERT-based artificial neural networks) seem to be highly effective in detecting such clones, their pairwise comparison of every code pair in the target system(s) is inefficient and scales poorly on large codebases.We therefore introduce SSCD, a BERT-based clone detection approach that targets high recall of Type 3 and Type 4 clones at scale (in line with our industrial partner’s requirements). It does so by computing a representative embedding for each code fragment and finding similar fragments using a nearest neighbour search. SSCD thus avoids the pairwise-comparison bottleneck of other Neural Network approaches while also using parallel, GPU-accelerated search to tackle scalability.This paper details the approach and an empirical assessment towards configuring and evaluating that approach in industrial setting. The configuration analysis suggests that shorter input lengths and text-only based neural network models demonstrate better efficiency in SSCD, while only slightly decreasing effectiveness. The evaluation results suggest that SSCD is more effective than state-of-the-art approaches like SAGA and SourcererCC. It is also highly efficient: in its optimal setting, SSCD effectively locates clones in the entire 320 million LOC BigCloneBench (a standard clone detection benchmark) in just under three hours.",2576-3148,978-1-6654-7956-1,10.1109/ICSME55016.2022.00080,Science Foundation Ireland; ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9978241,Clone detection;semantic clones;scalable;deep neural networks,Deep learning;Software maintenance;Analytical models;Codes;Cloning;Artificial neural networks;Benchmark testing,graphics processing units;nearest neighbour methods;neural nets;software maintenance;text analysis,artificial deep neural networks;BERT-based clone detection approach;code clones;code fragment;code pair;code-bases;GPU-accelerated search;LOC BigCloneBench;nearest neighbour search;pairwise-comparison bottleneck;software maintenance;SSCD;standard clone detection benchmark;text-only based neural network model;Type 3 clones;Type 4 clones,,,,33.0,IEEE,19 Dec 2022,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,False,True,True,

The vast majority of existing AUC-optimization-based machine learning methods only focus on binary-class cases, while leaving the multiclass cases unconsidered. In this paper, we start an early trial to consider the problem of learning multiclass scoring functions via optimizing multiclass AUC metrics. Our foundation is based on the M metric, which is a well-known multiclass extension of AUC. We first pay a revisit to this metric, showing that it could eliminate the imbalance issue from the minority class pairs. Motivated by this, we propose an empirical surrogate risk minimization framework to approximately optimize the M metric. Theoretically, we show that: (i) optimizing most of the popular differentiable surrogate losses suffices to reach the Bayes optimal scoring function asymptotically; (ii) the training framework enjoys an imbalance-aware generalization error bound, which pays more attention to the bottleneck samples of minority classes compared with the traditional $O(\sqrt{1/N})$O(1/N) result. Practically, to deal with the low scalability of the computational operations, we propose acceleration methods for three popular surrogate loss functions, including the exponential loss, squared loss, and hinge loss, to speed up loss and gradient evaluations.

The competition between attack and defense methods also enhances the robustness of GNNs. In this competition, the development of adversarial training methods put forward higher requirement for the diversity of attack examples. By contrast, most attack methods with specific attack strategies are difficult to satisfy such a requirement. To address this problem, we propose GraphAttacker, a novel generic graph attack framework that can flexibly adjust the structures and the attack strategies according to the graph analysis tasks. GraphAttacker generates adversarial examples through alternate training on three key components: the multi-strategy attack generator (MAG), the similarity discriminator (SD), and the attack discriminator (AD), based on the generative adversarial network (GAN). Furthermore, we introduce a novel similarity modification rate (SMR) to conduct a stealthier attack considering the change of node similarity distribution.

Free Lunch for Testing: Fuzzing Deep-Learning Libraries from Open Source,A. Wei; Y. Deng; C. Yang; L. Zhang,Stanford University; University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; Nanjing University; University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,2022 IEEE/ACM 44th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE),20 Jun 2022,2022.0,,,995,1007,"Deep learning (DL) systems can make our life much easier, and thus are gaining more and more attention from both academia and industry. Meanwhile, bugs in DL systems can be disastrous, and can even threaten human lives in safety-critical applications. To date, a huge body of research efforts have been dedicated to testing DL models. However, interestingly, there is still limited work for testing the underlying DL libraries, which are the foundation for building, optimizing, and running DL models. One potential reason is that test generation for the underlying DL libraries can be rather challenging since their public APIs are mainly exposed in Python, making it even hard to automatically determine the API input parameter types due to dynamic typing. In this paper, we propose FreeFuzz, the first approach to fuzzing DL libraries via mining from open source. More specifically, FreeFuzz obtains code/models from three different sources: 1) code snippets from the library documentation, 2) library developer tests, and 3) DL models in the wild. Then, FreeFuzz automatically runs all the collected code/models with instrumentation to trace the dynamic information for each covered API, including the types and values of each parameter during invocation, and shapes of input/output tensors. Lastly, FreeFuzz will leverage the traced dynamic information to perform fuzz testing for each covered API. The extensive study of FreeFuzz on PyTorch and TensorFlow, two of the most popular DL libraries, shows that FreeFuzz is able to automatically trace valid dynamic information for fuzzing 1158 popular APIs, 9X more than state-of-the-art LEMON with 3.5X lower overhead than LEMON. To date, FreeFuzz has detected 49 bugs for PyTorch and TensorFlow (with 38 already confirmed by developers as previously unknown).",1558-1225,978-1-4503-9221-1,10.1145/3510003.3510041,"National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CCF-2131943,CCF-2141474);",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9793919,,Tensors;Shape;Instruments;Computer bugs;Documentation;Fuzzing;Libraries,application program interfaces;data mining;fuzzy set theory;learning (artificial intelligence);program debugging;program testing;security of data;Web services,dynamic typing;FreeFuzz;fuzzing DL libraries;open source;library documentation;covered API;traced dynamic information;fuzz testing;popular DL libraries;valid dynamic information;1158 popular APIs;free lunch;deep-learning libraries;deep learning systems;DL systems;human lives;safety-critical applications;huge body;underlying DL libraries;running DL models;test generation;public APIs;API input parameter types,,7.0,,84.0,,20 Jun 2022,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,False,True,True,

Sharing these increasing amounts of data for research is challenging, as privacy risks increase with the increased size of data. Physically moving very large datasets to researchers is inconvenient, as download or sending physical hard disks are not optimal. Research on sensitive data is often not possible, as sharing is not legal. The popularity of container-based technologies such as Docker has revolutionized the way applications are deployed, due to their self-sufficient, light-weight and portable nature. In this paper, we propose a novel distributed platform using containers for simple execution and evaluation of research applications on the data owner's infrastructure, bringing the algorithms to the data. This approach avoids the cumbersome transfer of large datasets and can help circumventing problems linked to non-shareable data by providing a sandboxed execution environment with read-only access to the data. At no point the data leave the data owner's site, giving researchers access to their evaluation results, only, and not the data themselves. The presented proof-of-concept confirms the feasibility of a distributed container-based evaluation platform for large and/or sensitive data. This has several advantages, including execution of code instead of submission of result files and availability of otherwise inaccessible data. The container architecture allows for minimal computational overhead, no software dependency management on the infrastructure, distributed runtime environment and isolation of processes from the underlying host system. A version addressing various identified architectural and security-related challenges has the potential to be deployed in a production setting and therefore allows researchers to gain insights from previously inaccessible data. One goal is to target hospitals with increasingly strong local infrastructure for storage and computation, needed for artificial intelligence based decision support (genetics and imaging).",,978-1-5386-5330-2,10.1109/ISPDC2018.2018.00022,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8452025,e-health;evaluation;distributed containerization;docker;big data;data privacy;reproducibility,Containers;Computer architecture;Task analysis;Machine learning;Distributed databases;Biomedical imaging;Graphics processing units,data privacy;decision support systems;Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data,distributed container-based evaluation platform;big data;artificial intelligence techniques;stored data;sensitive data;container-based technologies;data owner;nonshareable data;sandboxed execution environment;inaccessible data;container architecture;distributed runtime environment;artificial intelligence based decision support;privacy risks;distributed platform;local infrastructure,,,,26.0,IEEE,30 Aug 2018,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,False,True,True,

Due to the malicious obfuscation of attack codes and the gradual increase in number, the traditional XSS detection methods have some defects such as poor recognition of malicious attack codes, inadequate feature extraction and low efficiency. Therefore, we present a novel approach to detect XSS attacks based on the attention mechanism of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network.

We used the ability of LSTM model to extract context-related features for deep learning, the added attention mechanism made the model extract more effective features.

These attacks often employ multiple attack vectors for gaining initial access to the systems. Analysts are often challenged to identify malware objective, initial attack vectors, attack propagation, evading techniques, protective mechanisms and unseen techniques. Most of these attacks are frequently referred to as Multi stage attacks and pose a grave threat to organizations, individuals and the government. Early multistage attack detection is a crucial measure to counter malware and deactivate it. Most traditional security solutions use signature-based detection, which frequently fails to thwart zero-day attacks. Manual analysis of these samples requires enormous effort for effectively counter exponential growth of malware samples. In this paper, we present a novel approach leveraging Machine Learning and MITRE Adversary Tactic Technique and Common knowledge (ATT&CK) framework for early multistage attack detection in real time. Firstly, we have developed a run-time engine that receives notification while malicious executable is downloaded via browser or a launch of a new process in the system. Upon notification, the engine extracts the features from static executable for learning if the executable is malicious. Secondly, we use the MITRE ATT&CK framework, evolved based on the real-world observations of the cyber attacks, that best describes the multistage attack with respect to the adversary Tactics, Techniques and Procedure (TTP) for detecting the malicious executable as well as predict the stages that the malware executes during the attack. Lastly, we propose a real-time system that combines both these techniques for early multistage attack detection.

The purpose is to annex the generated data with the original train set for adversarial training to improve the detection performance of machine learning (ML) classifiers. The quality of generated adversarial samples relies on the adequacy of training data samples. However, in low data regimes like medical diagnostic imaging and cybersecurity, the anomaly samples are scarce in number. This paper proposes a novel GAN design called Evasion Generative Adversarial Network (EVAGAN) that is more suitable for low data regime problems that use oversampling for detection improvement of ML classifiers. EVAGAN not only can generate evasion samples, but its discriminator can act as an evasion-aware classifier. We have considered Auxiliary Classifier GAN (ACGAN) as a benchmark to evaluate the performance of EVAGAN on cybersecurity (ISCX-2014, CIC-2017 and CIC2018) botnet and computer vision (MNIST) datasets. We demonstrate that EVAGAN outperforms ACGAN for unbalanced datasets with respect to detection performance, training stability and time complexity. EVAGAN's generator quickly learns to generate the low sample class and hardens its discriminator simultaneously. In contrast to ML classifiers that require security hardening after being adversarially trained by GAN-generated data, EVAGAN renders it needless. The experimental analysis proves that EVAGAN is an efficient evasion hardened model for low data regimes for the selected cybersecurity and computer vision datasets. Code will be available at HTTPS://www.github.com/rhr407/EVAGAN. <italic>ImpStatement</italic> Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications can help improve the quality of human life. The use of AI is not only limited to medical anomaly detection and drug discovery but can be leveraged in computer networks to keep people safe from malicious activities on the Internet. However, the AI-based models can be biased towards the majority class of data on which they are trained due to data imbalance. Anomaly data samples are always scarce as compared to normal data samples. So this is an open research problem to solve.

Sign-OPT+: An Improved Sign Optimization Adversarial Attack,Y. Ran; Y. -G.

Due to the security issue, model providers usually constrain the number of queries. It is challenging for adversaries to attack a model with limited queries. Sign-OPT makes great advances in query complexity, which adopts the backtracking line-search to find the optimal search direction, meanwhile the binary search is employed to obtain the minimum-distortion adversarial example. We find that this binary search costs a huge amount of queries. This paper proposes an improved Sign-OPT, termed Sign-OPT+, to enhance query efficiency further. Instead of the binary search, at each line-search stage we directly judge whether the candidate example along the new search direction locates inside or outside the decision boundary. This judgment requires only one query to achieve the optimal search direction, significantly reducing the overall queries.

As a result, adversary can extract sensitive training data with high quality even from these deeply compressed models that are tailored for resource-limited devices. Our investigation shows that existing compressions like quantization, can serve as a defense against such an attack, by degrading the model accuracy and memorized data quality simultaneously. To overcome this defense, we take an initial attempt to design a simple but stealthy quantized correlation encoding attack flow from an adversary perspective.

Such information is important in modeling program functionality and can lead to more accurate defect prediction. In this paper, we propose a framework called Defect Prediction via Convolutional Neural Network (DP-CNN), which leverages deep learning for effective feature generation. Specifically, based on the programs' Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs), we first extract token vectors, which are then encoded as numerical vectors via mapping and word embedding. We feed the numerical vectors into Convolutional Neural Network to automatically learn semantic and structural features of programs. After that, we combine the learned features with traditional hand-crafted features, for accurate software defect prediction.

Various attacks and defenses are proposed to improve the adversarial robustness of modern-day deep learning architectures. While all these approaches help improve the robustness, one promising direction for improving adversarial robustness is unexplored, i.e., the complex topology of the neural network architecture. In this work, we address the following question: ""Can the complex topology of a neural network give adversarial robustness without any form of adversarial training?"". We answer this empirically by experimenting with different hand-crafted and NAS-based architectures. Our findings show that, for small-scale attacks, NAS-based architectures are more robust for small-scale datasets and simple tasks than hand-crafted architectures. However, as the size of the dataset or the complexity of task increases, hand-crafted architectures are more robust than NAS-based architectures. Our work is the first large-scale study to understand adversarial robustness purely from an architectural perspective. Our study shows that random sampling in the search space of DARTS (a popular NAS method) with simple ensembling can improve the robustness to PGD attack by nearly 12%. We show that NAS, which is popular for achieving SoTA accuracy, can provide adversarial accuracy as a free add-on without any form of adversarial training. Our results show that leveraging the search space of NAS methods with methods like ensembles can be an excellent way to achieve adversarial robustness without any form of adversarial training. We also introduce a metric that can be used to calculate the trade-off between clean accuracy and adversarial robustness.

Autoencoders are machine learning techniques that are used to find lower-dimensional representations, i.e. an encoding in latent space, from input space. With variational Autoencoders (VAE) this representation is not a single code word or vector but a probability distribution – greatly improving the robustness of the coding scheme. In contrast to VAE, we present a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE), which uses the latent representation to encode regular and malicious network traffic into a bimodal distribution. While regular autoencoders are unsupervised, we require some labeled data to tune the bimodal representations, thus turning the learning problem into a semi-supervised classification task. However, unknown threats (i.e. those not contained in labeled training data) can be detected as well.

On the Effectiveness of Small Input Noise for Defending Against Query-based Black-Box Attacks,J. Byun; H. Go; C.

Many studies have shown that attacks are also possible even in a black-box setting where an adversary cannot access the target model’s internal information. Most black-box attacks are based on queries, each of which obtains the target model’s output for an input, and many recent studies focus on reducing the number of required queries. In this paper, we pay attention to an implicit assumption of query-based black-box adversarial attacks that the target model’s output exactly corresponds to the query input. If some randomness is introduced into the model, it can break the assumption, and thus, query-based attacks may have tremendous difficulty in both gradient estimation and local search, which are the core of their attack process. From this motivation, we observe even a small additive input noise can neutralize most query-based attacks and name this simple yet effective approach Small Noise Defense (SND). We analyze how SND can defend against query-based black-box attacks and demonstrate its effectiveness against eight state-of-the-art attacks with CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets.

Embedding Java Classes with code2vec: Improvements from Variable Obfuscation,R. Compton; E. Frank; P. Patros; A.

However, many standard ML approaches require a numeric representation of data and cannot be applied directly to source code. Thus, to enable ML, we need to embed source code into numeric feature vectors while maintaining the semantics of the code as much as possible. code2vec is a recently released embedding approach that uses the proxy task of method name prediction to map Java methods to feature vectors. However, experimentation with code2vec shows that it learns to rely on variable names for prediction, causing it to be easily fooled by typos or adversarial attacks. Moreover, it is only able to embed individual Java methods and cannot embed an entire collection of methods such as those present in a typical Java class, making it difficult to perform predictions at the class level (e.g., for the identification of malicious Java classes). Both shortcomings are addressed in the research presented in this paper. We investigate the effect of obfuscating variable names during training of a code2vec model to force it to rely on the structure of the code rather than specific names and consider a simple approach to creating class-level embeddings by aggregating sets of method embeddings. Our results, obtained on a challenging new collection of source-code classification problems, indicate that obfuscating variable names produces an embedding model that is both impervious to variable naming and more accurately reflects code semantics.

In order to satisfy such quality concerns, software architects are accountable for devising and comparing various alternate solutions, assessing the trade-offs, and finally adopting strategic design decisions which optimize the degree to which each of the quality concerns is satisfied. Although designing and implementing a good architecture is necessary, it is not usually enough. Even a good architecture can deteriorate in subsequent releases and then fail to address those concerns for which it was initially designed. In this work, we present a novel traceability approach for automating the construction of traceabilty links for architectural tactics and utilizing those links to implement a change impact analysis infrastructure to mitigate the problem of architecture degradation.

Palmprint image contains abundant texture features, especially the orientation and scale features of palm lines. Existing palmprint recognition methods using texture features can be roughly categorized into two classes: coding based and local descriptor based methods. As compared with the latter class, the former one can make full use of the palmprint specific features and acquire fast matching speed. However, most existing coding based methods utilize the competitive coding scheme, which doesn't exploit the scale features of palmprint in their coding schemes. In this paper, we propose a discriminant orientation and scale features learning (DOSFL) for palmprint recognition. By introducing the idea of discriminant analysis into palmprint coding, DOSFL can extract the orientation and scale features with the most favorable discriminability. Then, DOSFL utilizes four code bits to represent both the orientation and scale features of palmprint, and employ the Hamming distance for code matching.

PurifyNet: A Robust Person Re-Identification Model With Noisy Labels,M. Ye; P. C. Yuen,"Department of Computer Science, Hong Kong Baptist University, Hong Kong; Department of Computer Science, Hong Kong Baptist University, Hong Kong",IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,4 Mar 2020,2020.0,15,,2655,2666,"Person re-identification (Re-ID) has been widely studied by learning a discriminative feature representation with a set of well-annotated training data. Existing models usually assume that all the training samples are correctly annotated. However, label noise is unavoidable due to false annotations in large-scale industrial applications. Different from the label noise problem in image classification with abundant samples, the person Re-ID task with label noise usually has very limited annotated samples for each identity. In this paper, we propose a robust deep model, namely PurifyNet, to address this issue. PurifyNet is featured in two aspects: 1) it jointly refines the annotated labels and optimizes the neural networks by progressively adjusting the predicted logits, which reuses the wrong labels rather than simply filtering them; 2) it can simultaneously reduce the negative impact of noisy labels and pay more attention to hard samples with correct labels by developing a hard-aware instance re-weighting strategy. With limited annotated samples for each identity, we demonstrate that hard sample mining is crucial for label corrupted Re-ID task, while it is usually ignored in existing robust deep learning methods. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate the robustness of PurifyNet over the competing methods under various settings. Meanwhile, we show that it consistently improves the unsupervised/video-based Re-ID methods.

When collecting this type of data, most contain no useful information to a target event. Thus, it is essential to filter out those noisy data at the earliest opportunity for a human expert to perform further inspection. Most existing solutions for event filtering rely on fully supervised methods for training. However, in many real-world scenarios, having access to large number of labeled samples is not possible. To deal with a few labeled sample training problem for event filtering, we propose a graph-based few-shot learning pipeline. We also release the Brazilian Protest Dataset to test our method.

In addition, EK can do self-protection by imitating a benign website or responding to end-users with HTTP 404 error code whenever it encountered an unsupported target web browser. As a result, detecting EK requires a lot of effort. However, when an EK launches an attack, there are some patterns of interactions between a host and a victim. In this work, we obtain a set of data from www.malware-traffic-analysis.net and analyze those interactions in order to identify a set of features. We use such features to build a model for classifying interaction patterns of each EK type. Our experiments show that, with 5,743 network flows and 45 features, our model using Decision tree approach can classify EK traffic and EK type with accuracy of 97.74% and 97.11% respectively.

In the field of information security, malware detection has been a key problem that academia and industry are committed to solving. Machine learning is an effective method for processing large-scale data, such as the Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) and deep neural network technology. Although these types of detection methods can deal with cyber threats, most feature extraction methods are based on the statistical information features of portable executable (PE) files and thus lack the decompiled code and execution flow structure of the PE samples. Therefore, we propose a Control-Flow Graph (CFG)- and Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN)-based malware classification system. The feature vectors of CFG basic blocks are generated using the large-scale pre-trained language model MiniLM, which is beneficial for the GIN to further learn and compress the CFG-based representation, and classified with multi-layer perceptron. In addition, we evaluated the effectiveness of the representation under different dimensions and classifiers. To evaluate our method, we set up a CFG-based malware detection graph dataset from a PE file of the Blue Hexagon Open Dataset for Malware Analysis (BODMAS), which we call the Malware Geometric Binary Dataset (MGD-BINARY) and collected the experimental results of CFG representation in different dimensions and classifier settings.

People with little software programming background could also develop Android applications by using this tool based on their requirements. The emergence of AGE dramatically improves the ease of developing essential software and lowers the level of programming skills required for app developers. However, it also provides easy access for attackers to quickly develop a large number of malicious applications, which will seriously affect the device and data security of regular users. Since AGE mainly generates applications based on some boilerplate codes, the code structures of malicious apps created by AGE have a high degree of similarity when these apps belong to the same family. Based on the assumption that the package directory structures of the software from the same family are also similar, we designed a novel feature construction method to describe the application. Using this method, we extracted features from the leaf nodes of the smali tree, while each smali tree corresponds to the smali directory of the application. Unlike traditional static feature extraction of applications, the feature construction method proposed in this paper can effectively counteract problems such as code obfuscation or reflection cause it can adequately reflect the semantic features of the smali files. To prove the effectiveness of tree-based features, we also conducted some experiments based on a dataset provided by the enterprise.

One promising approach to improve attack performance is utilizing the adversarial transferability between some white-box surrogate models and the target model (i.e., the attacked model). However, due to the possible differences on model architectures and training datasets between surrogate and target models, dubbed “surrogate biases”, the contribution of adversarial transferability to improving the attack performance may be weakened. To tackle this issue, we innovatively propose a black-box attack method by developing a novel mechanism of adversarial transferability, which is robust to the surrogate biases. The general idea is transferring partial parameters of the conditional adversarial distribution (CAD) of surrogate models, while learning the untransferred parameters based on queries to the target model, to keep the flexibility to adjust the CAD of the target model on any new benign sample.

Deep learning is an advanced method to deal with recognizing textual entailment tasks in an end-to-end manner. However, deep learning methods for ASAG still remain challenging mainly because of the following two major reasons: 1) high-precision scoring requires a deep understanding of the answer text; and 2) ASAG's corpus is usually small and cannot provide enough training data for deep learning. To address these challenges, in this article, we propose a novel bidirectional encoder representation from transformer (BERT)-based deep neural network framework for ASAG. First, we use a pretrained and fine-tuned BERT model to dynamically encode the answer text, which can effectively overcome the problem of a too small corpus in the ASAG task. Second, to generate a powerful semantic representation for ASAG, we construct a semantic refinement layer to refine the semantics of the BERT outputs, which consists of a bidirectional-Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network and a Capsule network with position information in parallel. Third, we propose a triple-hot loss strategy for regression tasks in ASAG, which changes the gold label representation in the standard cross-entropy loss function from one-hot to triple-hot.

To avoid the leakage of privacy information, many people are using adblockers to remove advertisements on web pages. This behavior of filtering advertisements seriously threatens the benefits of online publishers, and they have begun to detect and counterattack users who use adblockers. Previous work focused on detecting and filtering anti-adblockers to fight against the counterattacks of online publishers. So far, one of the most effective ways to prevent anti-adblockers is to create a blacklist. However, the generation and maintenance of blacklists involve considerable manual work, which is inefficient and difficult to maintain. This paper proposes a machine learning anti-adblocker detection system called ABDetector, which is the first system that can automatically generate blacklists of anti-adblockers. This system greatly reduces the manual workload. Since the difference of code with and without anti-adblocking detection behavior mainly lies in that they call different APIs, thus, we for the first time tried to build a classifier of anti-adblockers using JavaScript APIs as features and use dynamic analysis method to extract features.

Within the proposed framework, we use matrix multiplication, a fundamental building block of many distributed machine learning algorithms, as the representative computation task. To minimize resource consumption while achieving information-theoretic security, we investigate two highly-coupled problems, (1) task allocation that assigns data blocks in a computing task to edge devices and (2) linear code design that generates data blocks by encoding the original data with random information. Specifically, we first theoretically analyze the necessary conditions for the optimal solution. Based on the theoretical analysis, we develop an efficient task allocation algorithm to obtain a set of selected edge devices and the number of coded vectors allocated to them. Using the task allocation results, we then design secure coded computing schemes, for two cases, (1) with redundant computation and (2) without redundant computation, all of which satisfy the availability and security conditions.

A technology that does not meet the ethical criteria of a society is likely to face a long and hard process of acceptance regardless of its potentially tremendous positive potential for long-term socio-economic development. The development of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies is undoubtedly associated with the need to answer ethical questions, and the perception of AI in society will be largely determined by compliance with ethical criteria, whether written or not. At the same time, AI as a technological system itself does not have a natural ethical content; the authors believe that in practice ethical concerns may be addressed by means of ethical codes and compliance rules that articulate what constitutes ethical behaviour in specific areas of application of AI systems. Such a set of rules (a code for AI ethics) could be followed by all actors throughout the complete lifecycle of the system starting with the design stage. The specification of general ethical principles as industry-specific codes of practice would also facilitate classification, evaluation and measurement of systems, both at the technical level and at the level of public perception and trust.The article considers examples of codification of ethical principles and offers several approaches for practical use in solving issues of ethics in the field of AI at the national and international level.",,978-1-7281-8090-8,10.1109/EnT48576.2020.00011,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9140627,ethics;AI;codification;regulation;standards;responsibility;bias;trustworthiness;personal data protection;international cooperation in AI;soft regulation,Artificial intelligence;Ethics;Robots;Standards;Security;Tools;Business,artificial intelligence;ethical aspects;socio-economic effects,AI ethics systems;industry-specific codes;social welfare-development;ethical principles;ethical codes;artificial intelligence technologies;long-term socio-economic development,,2.0,,29.0,IEEE,15 Jul 2020,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,False,True,True,

Ishchenko,"Hitachi Energy Research Center, Raleigh, NC, USA; Hitachi Energy Research Center, Raleigh, NC, USA",2022 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting (IAS),17 Nov 2022,2022.0,,,1,8,"Network constrained grid edge energy management system (EMS) provides economic solution for active and reactive power dispatch of distributed energy resources (DERs) at the grid edge level. Grid edge EMS ensures secure interconnection of a circuit segment to the distribution system by maintaining grid code requirements (e.g. IEEE 1547–2018). Grid edge EMS is dependent on communication to receive load measurement, which brings a risk of unobservable false data injection attacks (FDIAs). To mitigate the risk, this paper proposes a framework to enhance resilient operation of grid edge EMS by detecting the unobservable FDIAs on loads and replacing them with forecasted values. In this work, a two-step detection algorithm is proposed. In first step, conventional residual based algorithm is deployed. Autoencoder (AE) based data driven mechanism is included in second step to detect the presence of unobservable FDIAs. After ensuring the presence of FDIA, its specific location is detected by checking the maximum residue values till the predefined threshold value is reached. Detected false data injected loads are then replaced with forecasted load values following long-short term memory (LSTM) based forecast to ensure resilient performance of grid edge EMS in the presence of attacks. This proposed security enhancement framework for grid edge EMS is evaluated in IEEE 13 bus system with three integrated DERs.

The resulting security risks of IoT have attracted more and more attention. Being different from the traditional authentication that is based on MAC or security certificate, RF fingerprinting technology extracts fingerprints from the emissions of wireless transmitters. These fingerprints root in the hardware imperfection of the transmitting circuits and can be used for wireless device identification and authentication. RF fingerprinting can effectively enhance the security of the wireless network and has become a research focus in the field of IoT. However, how to learn and fuse multiple RF fingerprints is still an urgent problem to be solved. Inspired by the attention mechanism in the field of computer vision, an adaptive RF fingerprints fusion network (ARFNet) is proposed in this article, which is built on our dual attention convolution (DAConv) layer. This neural network can extract and adaptively fuse multiple RF fingerprints in a data-driven manner to obtain more discriminant features. In addition, a data augmentation method is also designed to effectively enhance the network’s robustness to channel variation and SNR variation. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed ARFNet combined with data augmentation can achieve 99.5% recognition accuracy on five USRP X310, and achieve 95.7% recognition accuracy on 56 ADS-B devices.

For deeply dissecting and detecting the expected signals, the research community has to investigate the smart signal processing technology to resisting the influence of detrimental signals. For this purpose, blind source separation has been shown to be a promising method for achieving simultaneous spectrum utilization and wireless adaptive interference cancellation. The attractive features and appealing advantages of blind source separation make it an attractive theory for source extraction or recovery, which plays a crucial role in helping realize intelligent signal processing for wireless communication. It can recover the unobserved sources only from the wireless received mixed signals based on the features of the source signal exempted from channel estimation and synchronization manipulation. Wireless communication systems can benefit the high spectrum efficiency, strong anti-interference, and adaptive signal processing through the blind separation mechanism. So far, numerous researchers have made tremendous efforts to investigate this field for enhancing spectrum efficiency, anti-interference ability, and signal detection performance through employing the philosophy of blind separation. These meaningful and appealing research works motivate us to make a comprehensive survey with regard to this area.

However, it is still a very challenging task to detect face spoofing attacks, thus face anti-spoofing has become one of the most important research topics in the community. Though various anti-spoofing models have been proposed, the generalisation capability of these models usually degrades for unseen attacks in the presence of challenging appearance variations, e.g., background, illumination, diverse spoofing materials and low image quality. To address this issue, we propose to use a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) that transfers an input face image from the RGB domain to the depth domain. The generated depth clue enables biometric preservation against challenging appearance variations and diverse image qualities. To be more specific, the proposed method has two main stages. The first one is a GAN-based domain transfer module that converts an input image to its corresponding depth map. By design, a live face image should be transferred to a depth map whereas a spoofing face image should be transferred to a plain (black) image. The aim is to improve the discriminative capability of the proposed system. The second stage is a classification model that determines whether an input face image is live or spoofing. Benefit from the use of the GAN-based domain transfer module, the latent variables can effectively represent the depth information, complementarily enhancing the discrimination of the original RGB features. The experimental results obtained on several benchmarking datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, with superior performance over the state-of-the-art methods.

The existed deep learning approaches have effectively improved the performance of presentation attack detection (PAD). However, they learn a uniform feature for different types of presentation attacks, which ignore the diversity of the inherent cues presented in different spoofing types. As a result, they can not effectively represent the intrinsic difference between different spoof faces and live faces, and the performance drops on the cross-domain databases. In this paper, we introduce the inherent cues of different spoofing types by non-uniform learning as complements to uniform features. Two lightweight sub-networks are designed to learn inherent motion patterns from photo attacks and the inherent texture cues from video attacks. Furthermore, an element-wise weighting fusion strategy is proposed to integrate the non-uniform inherent cues and uniform features.

Confidential data can be secured using a steganography technique by inserting the data into a cover media, in this case, the cover media is in the form of video. This video becomes a medium for sending a message in real time, which is known as video streaming. However, video streaming has the potential for packet loss. This paper proposes a fault tolerant scheme in steganographic video streaming by using repetition code for ensuring the reception of hidden information in a noisy channel such as packet drop in video streaming. This idea comes from the simplest error correction that can minimize errors in the transmission process of data information with the aim of finding the best fault-tolerant value for video steganography. The method used in this study during video streaming is repetition code with n = odd and multiples of 3. This study describes the embedding and extraction process using the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) method on the YUV color space - Luminance(Y) Chrominance (”U” and ”V”), especially Luminance (Y) channel. The measurement of packet loss effect is done by using Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) calculation, in which the higher the PSNR value, the higher the quality of the reconstruction. The use of the DWT method which offers high resolution at low frequencies provides a PSNR value of 131.49 dB with the use of the H.265 codec when the packet drop is at a percentage of 15%, as well as message insertion and repetition in every odd frame (1, 3, 5, 7, …853).",,978-1-6654-5126-0,10.1109/IAICT55358.2022.9887523,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9887523,Fault tolerant;Steganography;Packet loss;Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT);Video Streaming,Fault tolerance;Steganography;Codes;Codecs;PSNR;Fault tolerant systems;Packet loss,discrete wavelet transforms;error correction codes;fault tolerance;image reconstruction;image resolution;steganography;video coding;video streaming,steganographic video streaming;repetition code;information security;confidential data information;packet drop;video steganography;fault-tolerant value scheme;DWT method;discrete wavelet transform method;YUV color space;PSNR calculation;peak signal to noise ratio calculation;H.265 codec;noise figure 131.49 dB,,,,14.0,IEEE,16 Sep 2022,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,False,True,True,

Unfortunately, it is not uncommon for developers to inadvertently leak secrets (e.g. API keys, credentials) and confidential source code on public Git repositories, facilitating numerous security breaches that impact reputation and result in losing revenue. Current Git leak detection strategies and tools often fall short due to a high false-positive rate, an ever-growing number of platforms and repositories to inspect, and a limited reach. This paper investigates the shortcomings of traditional Git leak detection methodologies and introduces an alternative approach to overcome those shortcomings. The approach consists of identifying all Git repositories associated with an organisation by collecting the URLs and the respective maintainer names from its endpoint fleet, empowering blue-teams to prioritise content inspection efforts against a well-defined set of targets and to boost incident response capabilities.

This form of malicious software takes user files hostage by encrypting them and demands a large ransom payment for providing the decryption key. Signature-based methods employed by Antivirus Software are insufficient to evade Ransomware attacks due to code obfuscation techniques and creation of new polymorphic variants everyday. Generic Malware Attack vectors are also not robust enough for detection as they do not completely track the specific behavioral patterns shown by Cryptographic Ransomware families. This work based on analysis of an extensive dataset of Ran-somware families presents RansomWall, a layered defense system for protection against Cryptographic Ransomware.

Following recent progresses along this line, we investigate a number of watermark-based DNN ownership verification methods in the face of ambiguity attacks, which aim to cast doubts on the ownership verification by forging counterfeit watermarks. It is shown that ambiguity attacks pose serious threats to existing DNN watermarking methods. As remedies to the above-mentioned loophole, this paper proposes novel passport-based DNN ownership verification schemes which are both robust to network modifications and resilient to ambiguity attacks. The gist of embedding digital passports is to design and train DNN models in a way such that, the DNN inference performance of an original task will be significantly deteriorated due to forged passports. In other words, genuine passports are not only verified by looking for the predefined signatures, but also reasserted by the unyielding DNN model inference performances.

However, due to smart contract execution environment architectural defects, it is challenging for previous BC-AI systems to support computing-intensive tasks on-chain performing such as DNN convolution operations. They have to offload computations and a large amount of data from blockchain to off-chain platforms to execute smart contracts as native code. This failure to take advantage of data locality has become one of the major critical performance bottlenecks in BC-AI system. To this end, in this article, we propose SmartVM with optimization methods to support on-chain DNN inference for BC-AI system. The key idea is to design and optimize the computing mechanism and storage structure of smart contract execution environment according to the characteristics of DNN such as high computational parallelism and large data volume. We decompose SmartVM into three components: 1) a compact DNN-oriented instruction set to describe computations in a short number of instructions to reduce interpretation time. 2) a memory management mechanism to make SmartVM memory dynamic free/allocated according to the size of DNN feature maps. 3) a block-based weight prefetching and parallel computing method to organize each layer's computing and weights prefetching in a pipelined manner. We perform the typical image classification in a private Ethereum blockchain testbed to evaluate SmartVM performance. Experimental results highlight that SmartVM can support DNN inference on-chain with roughly the same efficiency against the native code execution. Compared with the traditional off-chain computing, SmartVM can speed up the overall execution by 70×, 16×, 11×, and 12× over LeNet5, AlexNet, ResNet18, and MobileNet, respectively. The memory footprint can be reduced by 84%, 90.8%, 94.3%, and 93.7% over the above four models, while offering the same level model accuracy.

Although the existing methods have noticed the importance of local features, near-duplicated cases are still hard to be handled. The reason lies that the attribute features and personalized structure of vehicles are often ignored. In this paper, we propose a graph-based structural attribute network (GSAN), which contains an attribute feature extraction module (AFEM) and a dual-grained structural relation module (DSRM).

These networks can decorate the predicted contents with high-frequency details by borrowing or copying neural information from the known region. However, this operation might introduce undesired content change in the synthesized region, especially when similar neural patterns cannot be found in the known region. To solve this problem, we present a network named Artist-Net to decompose an image into the content code and style code explicitly. The Artist-Net completes a corrupted image following the way an artist restores a damaged picture. It can produce more detailed content by inferring the content code of the corrupted images in the latent space since the dimension of the content space is lower than the original image. The Artist-Net can also keep style consistent over the entire image by decorating the inferred content code with the style code extracted from the known region.

However, they also make a CPS vulnerable to cyberattacks that can cause disruptions or even severe damage. This article focuses on one particular type of CPS cyberattack, namely the time delay attack (TDA), which exploits vulnerabilities in the communication channels to cause potentially serious harm to the system. Much work proposed for TDA detection is tested offline only and under strong assumptions. In order to construct a practical solution to deal with real-world scenarios, we propose a deep learning-based method to detect and characterize TDA. Specifically, we design a hierarchical long short-term memory model to process raw data streams from relevant CPS sensors online and continually monitor embedded signals in the data to detect and characterize the attack. Moreover, various strategies of interpreting the outputs of the model are proposed, which allow the user to tune the performance based on different objectives.

In practice, the pre-specified fixed number of classes and examples per class may not be available, meaning one cannot update the model. Evaluation of FSCIL approaches in such unnatural settings renders their applicability questionable for practical scenarios where such assumptions do not hold. To mitigate the limitation of FFSCIL, we propose Variable-Few-Shot Class Incremental Learning (VFSCIL) and demonstrate it with Up-to N-Ways, Up-to K-Shots class incremental learning; wherein each incremental session, a learner may have up to N classes and up to K samples per class. Consequently, conventional FFSCIL is a special case of herein introduced VFSCIL. Further, we extend VFSCIL to a more practical problem of Variable-Few-Shot Open-World Learning (VFSOWL), where an agent is not only required to perform incremental learning, but must detect unknown samples and enroll only those that it detects correctly. We formulate and study VFSCIL and VFSOWL on two benchmark datasets conventionally employed for FFSCIL i.e., Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 (CUB200) and miniImageNet. First, to serve as a strong baseline, we extend the state-of-the-art FSCIL approach to operate in Up-to N-Ways, Up-to K-Shots class incremental and open-world settings. Then, we propose a novel but simple approach for VFSCIL/VFSOWL where we leverage the current advancements in self-supervised feature learning.

This process tends to be expensive both in time and money, and is prone to errors. Additionally, reviewing an entire labeled dataset manually is often prohibitively costly, so many real world datasets contain mislabeled instances.To address this issue, we present in this paper a non-parametric end-to-end pipeline to find mislabeled instances in numerical, image and natural language datasets.

No.04TH8720),20 Dec 2004,2004.0,5,,3064,3078 Vol.5,"Bringing technology from the research world into an operational environment poses many challenges. Typically, software systems having their origins in low technical readiness level research projects have few, if any, formal requirements associated with them. This paucity of formal requirements coupled with the challenges associated with coordinating multiple, distributed research-oriented software projects makes it difficult to design and build software systems that will ultimately be useful in an operational environment. Targeted for current and next-generation space vehicles, the diagnostic applications that compose the advanced diagnostic system (ADS) under development in our lab at NASA-Ames Research Center are realizations of research projects associated with multiple organizations and generally are not designed according to stringent requirements nor with integration into the ADS environment in mind. The core functionality of a Diagnostic Client Application, usually having its basis in artificial intelligence research, is the primary (and perhaps sole) consideration of the application developer. Research funds generally are not available for implementing aspects such as logging and security, both of which are critical in aerospace diagnostic systems such as the ADS. Aspect-oriented programming (AOP) is a new software development methodology that complements object-oriented programming and addresses the complexity of software systems by achieving a separation of functional and interaction components (aspects). Aspects such as logging and security are defined as properties that cut across groups of functional components (diagnostic applications). Aspects can be thought about and analyzed separately from each other and from the core functionality of the software system. AOP provides the modular separation of crosscutting concerns, where the aspect code is scattered/tangled throughout the software system. An AOP framework takes advantage of what AOP provides and enables us to build software systems that can be extended and adapted during runtime. In this paper we present an AOP framework for integrating software components into an advanced (artificial intelligence-based) diagnostic system and introduce a basic ontology for sharing knowledge between a community of diagnostic applications (agents).",1095-323X,0-7803-8155-6,10.1109/AERO.2004.1368112,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1368112,,Ontologies;Software systems;Application software;Artificial intelligence;Security;Object oriented programming;Software design;Space vehicles;Functional programming;Scattering,diagnostic expert systems;client-server systems;object-oriented programming;artificial intelligence;multi-agent systems;formal specification;fault diagnosis,aspect-oriented framework;software systems;formal requirements;distributed research-oriented software projects;operational environment;space vehicles;diagnostic applications;advanced diagnostic system;NASA-Ames Research Center;diagnostic client application;artificial intelligence;aerospace diagnostic systems;aspect-oriented programming;software development methodology;object-oriented,,2.0,,17.0,IEEE,20 Dec 2004,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,True,True,True,

Among the successful approaches for anomaly detection, a distinguished category of methods relies on predicting masked information (e.g. patches, future frames, etc.) and leveraging the reconstruction error with respect to the masked information as an abnormality score. Different from related methods, we propose to integrate the reconstruction-based functionality into a novel self-supervised predictive architectural building block. The proposed self-supervised block is generic and can easily be incorporated into various state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods. Our block starts with a convolutional layer with dilated filters, where the center area of the receptive field is masked. The resulting activation maps are passed through a channel attention module. Our block is equipped with a loss that minimizes the reconstruction error with respect to the masked area in the receptive field. We demonstrate the generality of our block by integrating it into several state-of-the-art frameworks for anomaly detection on image and video, providing empirical evidence that shows considerable performance improvements on MVTec AD, Avenue, and ShanghaiTech.

Semantic segmentation is a powerful computer-vision process using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify objects within an image. Semantic segmentation has numerous space-science and defense applications, from semantic labeling of Earth observations for insights about our changing planet, to monitoring natural disasters for damage control, to gathering intelligence for national defense and security. Despite these advantages, CNNs can be computationally expensive and prohibited on traditional radiation-hardened space processors, which are often generations behind their commercial-off-the-shelf counterparts in terms of performance and energy-efficiency. FPGA-based hybrid System-on-Chips (SoCs), which combine fixed-logic CPUs with reconfigurable-logic FPGAs, present numerous architectural advantages well-suited to address the computational capabilities required for high-performance, intelligent spacecraft.

We propose using static analysis test suites (i.e., repositories of ""benchmark"" programs that are purpose-built to test coverage and precision of static analysis tools) as a novel source of training data. In a case study, we generated a large quantity of alerts by executing various static analyzers on the Juliet C/C++ test suite, and we automatically derived ground truth labels for these alerts by referencing the Juliet test suite metadata.

Therefore, it is helpful to leverage additional information, e.g., the locations and dates for data shooting, which can be easily accessible but rarely exploited. In this paper, we first demonstrate that existing multimodal methods fuse multiple features only on a single dimension, which essentially has insufficient help in feature discrimination. To fully explore the potential of multimodal information, we propose a dynamic MLP on top of the image representation, which interacts with multimodal features at a higher and broader dimension. The dynamic MLP is an efficient structure parameterized by the learned embeddings of variable locations and dates. It can be regarded as an adaptive nonlinear projection for generating more discriminative image representations in visual tasks. To our best knowledge, it is the first attempt to explore the idea of dynamic networks to exploit multimodal information in fine-grained image classification tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The t-SNE algorithm visually indicates that our technique improves the recognizability of image representations that are visually similar but with different categories.

Unfortunately, they can be limited in their ability to model the subtlety and complexity of multiple vessel types and their spatio-temporal events, yet their representation is needed to accurately detect anomalies in maritime scenarios. To address these limitations, we apply plan recognition algorithms for maritime anomaly detection. In particular, we examine hierarchical task network (HTN) and case-based algorithms for plan recognition, which detect anomalies by generating expected behaviors for use as a basis for threat detection. We compare their performance with a behavior recognition algorithm on simulated riverine maritime traffic. On a set of simulated maritime scenarios, these plan recognition algorithms outperformed the behavior recognition algorithm, except for one reactive behavior task in which the inverse occurred. Furthermore, our case-based plan recognizer outperformed our HTN algorithm. On the short-term reactive planning scenarios, the plan recognition algorithms outperformed the behavior recognition algorithm on routine plan following. However, they are significantly outperformed on the anomalous scenarios.",,978-1-4673-2709-1,10.1109/THS.2012.6459857,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6459857,,Probabilistic logic;Collision avoidance;Hidden Markov models;Planning;Accuracy;Labeling;Prediction algorithms,case-based reasoning;marine systems;national security;naval engineering;planning,routine plan;short-term reactive planning scenarios;HTN algorithm;case-based plan recognizer;reactive behavior task;simulated maritime scenarios;simulated riverine maritime traffic;behavior recognition algorithm;case-based algorithms;hierarchical task network;maritime anomaly detection;plan recognition algorithms;spatio-temporal events;multiple vessel types;normalcy models;maritime threat detection,,3.0,,21.0,IEEE,14 Feb 2013,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,False,True,True,

However, the severe object overlapping in X-ray baggage images restricts the performance of common CNN-based segmentation methods greatly. Worse, no public dataset can be used to promote research in this challenging and promising area. In this paper, to cope with these problems, we present the first Prohibited Item X-ray segmentation dataset named PIXray. PIXray comprises 5,046 X-ray images, in which 15 classes of 14,976 prohibited items are annotated as instance-level masks. Besides, we contribute a dense de-overlap attention snake (DDoAS) in the context of deep learning for automated and real-time prohibited item segmentation. DDoAS mainly includes a dense de-overlap module (DDoM) and an attention deforming module (ADM). Specifically, DDoM is designed to infer prohibited item information accurately from extreme background overlaps through dense reversed connections. ADM aims to improve the low learning efficiency introduced by large variations in shapes and sizes among different prohibited items. Comprehensive evaluation on the PIXray shows the effectiveness and superiority of DDoM and ADM. DDoM excels at recognizing prohibited items from complex backgrounds than other in-domain methods and achieves consistent performance gain over various network backbones, extending the idea of tackling overlapping images data. ADM can ease the model training and further refine the mask quality. Furthermore, out-of-domain experiments prove that DDoAS can also be applied to natural images and achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art methods, which implies its potential applications in other fields.

However, their assumptions about the training program are not always true as training programs can contain inconsistencies and bugs. In this paper, we examine training issues in ML programs and propose a catalog of verification routines that can be used to detect the identified issues, automatically.

Recently, several efforts have shown success in applying deep learning techniques for automatic vulnerability discovery, as alternatives to traditional static bug detection. In principle, these learning-based approaches are built on top of classification models using supervised learning. Depending on the different granularities to detect vulnerabilities, these approaches rely on learning models which are typically trained with well-labeled source code to predict whether a program method, a program slice, or a particular code line contains a vulnerability or not. The effectiveness of these models is normally evaluated against conventional metrics including precision, recall and F1 score. In this paper, we show that despite yielding promising numbers, the above evaluation strategy can be insufficient and even misleading when evaluating the effectiveness of current learning-based approaches. This is because the underlying learning models only produce the classification results or report individual/isolated program statements, but are unable to pinpoint bug-triggering paths, which is an effective way for bug fixing and the main aim of static bug detection. Our key insight is that a program method or statement can only be stated as vulnerable in the context of a bug-triggering path. In this work, we systematically study the gap between recent learning-based approaches and conventional static bug detectors in terms of fine-grained metrics called BTP metrics using bug-triggering paths. We then characterize and compare the quality of the prediction results of existing learning-based detectors under different granularities. Finally, our comprehensive empirical study reveals several key issues and challenges in developing classification models to pinpoint bug-triggering paths and calls for more advanced learning-based bug detection techniques.",1941-0018,,10.1109/TDSC.2022.3192419,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9833339,Software Vulnerabilities;Machine Learning;Bug-Triggering Paths;Empirical Study,Computer bugs;Codes;Measurement;Feature extraction;Detectors;Training;Predictive models,,,,,,,IEEE,19 Jul 2022,,,IEEE,IEEE Early Access Articles,False,True,True,

Despite its significant progress in recent years, there are still two challenging issues in the current ensemble clustering research. First, most of the existing algorithms tend to investigate the ensemble information at the object-level, yet often lack the ability to explore the rich information at higher levels of granularity. Second, they mostly focus on the direct connections (e.g., direct intersection or pair-wise co-occurrence) in the multiple base clusterings, but generally neglect the multiscale indirect relationship hidden in them. To address these two issues, this paper presents a novel ensemble clustering approach based on fast propagation of cluster-wise similarities via random walks. We first construct a cluster similarity graph with the base clusters treated as graph nodes and the cluster-wise Jaccard coefficient exploited to compute the initial edge weights. Upon the constructed graph, a transition probability matrix is defined, based on which the random walk process is conducted to propagate the graph structural information. Specifically, by investigating the propagating trajectories starting from different nodes, a new cluster-wise similarity matrix can be derived by considering the trajectory relationship. Then, the newly obtained cluster-wise similarity matrix is mapped from the cluster-level to the object-level to achieve an enhanced co-association matrix, which is able to simultaneously capture the object-wise co-occurrence relationship as well as the multiscale cluster-wise relationship in ensembles. Finally, two novel consensus functions are proposed to obtain the consensus clustering result.

Hence, fingerprint matching is a key process. The efficiency of current matching algorithms does not allow their use in large fingerprint databases; to apply them, a breakthrough in running performance is necessary. Nowadays, the minutia cylinder-code (MCC) is the best performing algorithm in terms of accuracy. However, a weak point of this algorithm is its computational requirements.

Through a thorough and careful data structure, computation and memory transfer design, we have developed a system that keeps its accuracy and reaches a speed-up up to 100.8× compared with a reference sequential CPU implementation.

In this way, multiscale contextual information with long-range dependencies can be captured to tackle scale variations of vessels. Meanwhile, these attention feature maps are gradually integrated into multi-level aggregate supervision to assemble multiscale context information for refining segmentation results.

To portray a gait, existing gait recognition methods utilize either a gait template which makes it difficult to preserve temporal information, or a gait sequence that maintains unnecessary sequential constraints and thus loses the flexibility of gait recognition. In this paper, we present a novel perspective that utilizes gait as a deep set, which means that a set of gait frames are integrated by a global-local fused deep network inspired by the way our left- and right-hemisphere processes information to learn information that can be used in identification. Based on this deep set perspective, our method is immune to frame permutations, and can naturally integrate frames from different videos that have been acquired under different scenarios, such as diverse viewing angles, different clothes, or different item-carrying conditions. Experiments show that under normal walking conditions, our single-model method achieves an average rank-1 accuracy of 96.1 percent on the CASIA-B gait dataset and an accuracy of 87.9 percent on the OU-MVLP gait dataset. Under various complex scenarios, our model also exhibits a high level of robustness.

Diversity and heterogeneity of these services raise many needs for the integration. To meet these needs, the Enterprise Service Bus has been proposed for the development of standard based collaborative strategies between services and applications. However the lack of semantic, the competitiveness between services and the dynamicity of service-oriented architectures contexts (mobility, increase of consumers and providers of services, etc.) are the reason of unpredictable events such as service unavailability, high overhead and response time, decrease of reliability, security, etc. Those events ask to adapt the established integration strategies to ensure or improve performance and Quality of Service offered by the Enterprise Service Bus.

Unfortunately, the complexity of modern software systems makes it impossible to anticipate all possible problems that can occur at runtime, which limits what issues can be found using testing and reviews. Thus, it is of interest to consider autonomous self-healing software systems, which can automatically detect, diagnose, and contain unanticipated problems at runtime. Most research in this area has adopted a model-driven approach, where actual behavior is checked against a model specifying the intended behavior, and a controller takes action when the system behaves outside of the specification. However, it is not easy to develop these specifications, nor to keep them up-to-date as the system evolves. We pose that, with the recent advances in machine learning, such models may be learned by observing the system. Moreover, we argue that artificial immune systems (AISs) are particularly well-suited for building self-healing systems, because of their anomaly detection and diagnosis capabilities.

To address the problems of low efficiency, long time, and low evasion rate in generating adversarial samples, we propose a co-evolutionary algorithm-based adversarial sample generation method. We decompose the adversarial sample generation problem into three sub-problems, which are minimizing the number of modification actions, injecting less content, and being detected as benign by the target model. The two sub-problems of injecting less content and being detected as benign by the target model can be completed by minimizing the fitness function through the cooperation of two populations in coevolution. Minimizing the number of actions is achieved by a selection operation in the evolutionary process. We perform attack experiments on static malicious detection models and commercial detection engines. The experimental results show the generated adversarial samples can improve the evasion rate of some detection engines while ensuring the minimum number of modification actions and injecting less content. On the two static malicious detection models, our approach achieves more than an 80% evasion rate with fewer modification actions and injected content. The evasion rate on three commercial detection engines can reach 58.9%. Uploading the generated adversarial samples to the VirusTotal platform can evade an average of 54.0% of the anti-virus programs on the platform.

Most existing approaches synthesize a new image and employ it as the supervision signal for depth and pose prediction. There are two problems in these approaches: 1) There are many combinations of pose and depth that can synthesize a certain new image; therefore, reconstructing the depth and pose based on the view-synthesis method from only two images is an inherently ill-posed problem; 2) The model is trained under the photometric consistency assumption that the brightness or gradient is constant when applied to the video sequences. However, this assumption is easily violated in realistic scenes due to light changes, reflective surfaces and occlusions. To overcome the first drawback, we exploit the point cloud consistency constraint to eliminate ambiguity. To overcome the second drawback, we use threshold masks to filter dynamic and occluded points and introduce matching point constraints that implicitly encode the geometry relationship between two matched points to improve the precision of depth prediction. In addition, we employ epipolar constraints to compensate for the instability of the photometric error in textureless regions and varying illumination conditions. The experimental results on the KITTI, Cityscapes and NYUv2 datasets show that the method can improve the accuracy of depth prediction and enhance the robustness of the model in handling textureless regions and illumination changes.

A model-free off-policy actor-critic algorithm is then employed for end-to-end learning of a policy that directly maps compact octree observations to continuous actions in Cartesian space. Experimental evaluation indicates that 3D data representations enable more effective learning of manipulation skills when compared to traditionally used image-based observations. Domain randomization improves the generalization of learned policies to novel scenes with previously unseen objects and different illumination conditions.

Fourth, we design the large-margin feature (LMF) regularization to make the learned features satisfy that the distances of similar sample pairs are minimized and the distances of dissimilar sample pairs are larger than a predefined margin.

However, this is a challenging problem due to the factors related to the limited object size, large intra-class variations of objects in a same class owing to different viewing angles and lighting, and real-time performance requirement in real-world applications. This paper describes an appearance-based method to achieve real-time and robust objects classification in diverse camera viewing angles. A new descriptor, i.e., the Multi-block Local Binary Pattern (MB-LBP), is proposed to capture the large-scale structures in object appearances. Based on MB-LBP features, an adaBoost algorithm is introduced to select a subset of discriminative features as well as construct the strong two-class classifier.

MLaaS applications often rely on centralised collection and aggregation of user data, which could lead to significant privacy concerns when dealing with sensitive personal data. To address this problem, we propose PrivEdge, a technique for privacy-preserving MLaaS that safeguards the privacy of users who provide their data for training, as well as users who use the prediction service. With PrivEdge, each user independently uses their private data to locally train a one-class reconstructive adversarial network that succinctly represents their training data. As sending the model parameters to the service provider in the clear would reveal private information, PrivEdge secret-shares the parameters among two non-colluding MLaaS providers, to then provide cryptographically private prediction services through secure multi-party computation techniques. We quantify the benefits of PrivEdge and compare its performance with state-of-the-art centralised architectures on three privacy-sensitive image-based tasks: individual identification, writer identification, and handwritten letter recognition.

In general, linear coding can achieve data confidentiality by adding random information to the original data before they are distributed to edge devices. To this end, it is important to carefully design code such that the user can successfully decode the final result while achieving security requirements. Meanwhile, task allocation, which selects a set of edge devices to participate in a computation task, affects not only the total resource consumption, including computation, storage, and communication, but also coding design.

The proposed approach has been shaped within an architectural framework called anomalous resource consumption detection (ARCD). The approach’s detection mechanism detects cyber-attacks by distinguishing anomalous performance and resource consumption patterns from a pre-determinable reference model. The defense mechanism of this approach acts as an additional layer of protection for ESs. This technique’s effectiveness was previously evaluated statistically, and in this paper, we tested this approach’s efficiency computationally by using the support-vector machine algorithm. The datasets were generated and collected based on a testbed model, where it was run repeatedly under different operation conditions (normal cases (Rs) versus attacked cases). The executed attack scenarios are 1) denial-of-service (DoS); 2) brute force (BF); and 3) remote code execution (RCE), and man-in-the-middle (MITM). A septenary tuple model, which consists of seven determinants that are analyzed based on seven statistical criteria, is the core of the detection mechanism. The prediction accuracy in terms of classifying anomalous patterns compared to normal patterns based on the confusion matrix revealed promising results, proving this approach’s effectiveness, where the final results confirmed very high prediction accuracies in terms of distinguishing anomalous patterns from the typical patterns. Integrating the ARCD concept into an operating system’s functionality could help software developers augment the existing security countermeasures of ESs.

We performed experiments on a pre-trained ANN, whose weights represent the sensitive IP of our system.

It is thus imperative to devise effective attack algorithms to identify the deficiencies of DNNs beforehand in security-sensitive applications. To efficiently tackle the black-box setting where the target model's particulars are unknown, feature-level transfer-based attacks propose to contaminate the intermediate feature outputs of local models, and then directly employ the crafted adversarial samples to attack the target model. Due to the transferability of features, feature-level attacks have shown promise in synthesizing more transferable adversarial samples. However, existing feature-level attacks generally employ inaccurate neuron importance estimations, which deteriorates their transferability. To overcome such pitfalls, in this paper, we propose the Neuron Attribution-based Attack (NAA), which conducts feature-level attacks with more accurate neuron importance estimations. Specifically, we first completely attribute a model's output to each neuron in a middle layer. We then derive an approximation scheme of neuron attribution to tremendously reduce the computation overhead. Finally, we weight neurons based on their attribution results and launch feature-level attacks. Extensive experiments confirm the superiority of our approach to the state-of-the-art benchmarks.

Several prior works have utilized side-channel leakage to recover the model architecture while the an DNN is executing on a hardware acceleration platform. In this work, we target an open-source deep-learning accelerator, Versatile Tensor Accelerator (VTA), and utilize electromagnetic (EM) side-channel leakage to comprehensively learn the association between DNN architecture configurations and EM emanations. We also consider the holistic system–including the low-level tensor program code of the VTA accelerator on a Xilinx FPGA, and explore the effect of such low-level configurations on the EM leakage.

Specifically, NNReArch targets reshaping the EM traces of different DNN operators, through scheduling the tensor program execution of the DNN model so as to confuse the adversary.

However, these medical records need to ensure authorization demands in the channel model for human body communication and remote medical servers and enhance the confidentiality, recoverability, and availability of transmission data. Hence, this study proposes a symmetric cryptography scheme with a chaotic map and a multilayer machine learning network (MMLN) to achieve physiological signal infosecurity. A chaotic pseudorandom number generator within specific control parameters can dynamically produce unordered sequence numbers to set the secret keys for a regular secret key update, thereby improving the security of private cipher codes. The chaotic map is quickly iterated to produce a pseudorandom key stream for real-time applications, and the private cipher codes are selected using the initial and specific control parameters at the data emitter and receiver ends. A general regression neural network is used to map the high-dimensional input-output pair of cipher codes for substitution and permutation processes. Its adaptive MMLN with an optimization algorithm can rapidly train the random cipher code protocol to achieve an encryptor and a decryptor for a regular encrypted communication. Using the Massachusetts Institute of Technology-Beth Israel Hospital (MIT-BIH) Arrhythmia Database, 100 electrocardiogram fragments are used to verify the proposed model, and the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) as a quantitative quality metric is used to evaluate the visual quality after encryption and decryption processes for further diagnosis applications.

However, DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which pose great security concerns for security-critical systems. Researchers recently devised adversarial patches to evaluate the vulnerability of DNN-based aerial detection methods physically. Nonetheless, adversarial patches generated by the existing algorithms are not strong enough and extremely time-consuming. Moreover, complicated physical factors are not accommodated well during the optimization process. In this article, a novel adaptive-patch-based physical attack (AP-PA) framework is proposed to alleviate the above problems, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, AP-PA aims to generate adversarial patches that are adaptive in both physical dynamics and varying scales, and by which the particular targets can be hidden from being detected. Furthermore, the adversarial patch is also gifted with attack effectiveness against all targets of the same class with a patch outside the target (no need to smear targeted objects) and robust enough in the physical world. In addition, a new loss is devised to consider more available information of detected objects to optimize the adversarial patch, which can significantly improve the patch’s attack efficacy (average precision drop up to 87.86% and 85.48% in white-box and black-box settings, respectively) and optimizing efficiency. We also establish one of the first comprehensive, coherent, and rigorous benchmarks to evaluate the attack efficacy of adversarial patches on aerial detection tasks. Finally, several proportionally scaled experiments are performed physically to demonstrate that the elaborated adversarial patches can successfully deceive aerial detection algorithms in dynamic physical circumstances.

The pre-trained image encoder can then be used as a feature extractor to build downstream classifiers for many downstream tasks with a small amount of or no labeled training data. In this work, we propose BadEncoder, the first backdoor attack to self-supervised learning. In particular, our BadEncoder injects backdoors into a pre-trained image encoder such that the downstream classifiers built based on the backdoored image encoder for different downstream tasks simultaneously inherit the backdoor behavior. We formulate our BadEncoder as an optimization problem and we propose a gradient descent based method to solve it, which produces a backdoored image encoder from a clean one. Our extensive empirical evaluation results on multiple datasets show that our BadEncoder achieves high attack success rates while preserving the accuracy of the downstream classifiers. We also show the effectiveness of BadEncoder using two publicly available, real-world image encoders, i.e., Google’s image encoder pre-trained on ImageNet and OpenAI’s Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) image encoder pre-trained on 400 million (image, text) pairs collected from the Internet.

However, the acquisition of correct and massive labeled data of network traffic in the real environment remains a major challenge in this field. On the opposite, unlabeled traffic is extremely easy to obtain in a network. Therefore, the effective use of unlabeled data is of great significance to the development of modern communications. In this paper, we propose the Sauce model, which can effectively use unlabeled information to obtain high-quality clustering space. It is composed of Aux (auxiliary network) and AE (auto encoder), where Aux is designed for collaborative training with AE, affecting the distribution of samples in the latent space generated by AE. Sauce uses t-SNE (t- distributed stochastic neighbor embedding) to perform secondary dimensionality reduction on the latent code, and then uses a clustering algorithm for cluster analysis.

To address this problem, many biometric template protection algorithms have been reported but most have a trade-off between matching performance and template security. In this work, we propose a method for face template protection, which improves upon existing face template protection algorithm, to provide better matching performance. The proposed method uses deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), with one-shot and multi-shot enrollment, to learn a robust mapping from face images of the users to the unique binary codes (assigned to the users during enrollment phase). The cryptographic hash (like SHA-3 512) of the user's binary code represents the protected face template. The deep CNN is trained to minimize the intra-class variations and maximize the inter-class variations. During verification, given an input face image of a user, deep CNN predicts the binary code assigned to the user. The hash of the predicted binary code is matched with the hash of the actual binary code assigned to the user during enrollment. Three face datasets, namely CMU-PIE, FEI and Color FERET are used for evaluation. The proposed method improves the matching performance by ~6% and reduces Equal Error Rate by about 4 times when compared to related work, while providing high template security.",2160-7516,978-1-5386-6100-0,10.1109/CVPRW.2018.00087,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8575550,,Face;Biometrics (access control);Binary codes;Feature extraction;Cryptography;Transforms,binary codes;biometrics (access control);cryptography;face recognition;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets,enrollment phase;protected face template;deep CNN;intra-class variations;inter-class variations;input face image;predicted binary code;actual binary code;face datasets;matching performance;high template security;deep convolutional neural network;biometric template protection algorithms;face template protection algorithm;multishot enrollment;face images;unique binary codes;cryptographic hash;biometric data privacy;biometric data security;equal error rate,,24.0,,26.0,IEEE,16 Dec 2018,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,False,True,True,

By combining the TV regularization term with low rank prior, the 3D total variation (3DTV) regularizer has achieved advanced performance in general hyperspectral image (HSI) processing tasks. Intrinsically, 3DTV assumes i.i.d. sparsity structures on all bands of the gradient maps calculated along the spectrum and space of an HSI. This, however, largely deviates from the real-world cases, where the gradient maps generally have different while correlated gradient map structures across all bands. To alleviate this issue, we propose an enhanced 3DTV (E-3DTV) regularization term beyond the conventional. Instead of imposing sparsity on gradient maps themselves, the new term calculates sparsity on the subspace bases on gradient maps along all bands of an HSI, which naturally encodes the correlation and difference among all these bands, and thus more faithfully reflects the insightful configurations of an HSI. The E-3DTV term can easily replace the conventional 3DTV term and be embedded into an HSI processing model to ameliorate its performance. We made such attempts on two typical related tasks: HSI denoising and compressed sensing.

Due to the difficulty of data collection and annotation in nighttime surveillance, VI-ReID usually suffers from noise problems, making it challenging to directly learn part discriminative features. In order to improve the discriminability and enhance the robustness against noisy images, this paper proposes a novel dynamic tri-level relation mining (DTRM) framework by simultaneously exploring channel-level, part-level intra-modality, and graph-level cross-modality relation cues. To address the misalignment within the person images, we design an intra-modality weighted-part attention (IWPA) to construct part-aggregated representation. It adaptively integrates the body part relation into the local feature learning with a residual batch normalization (RBN) connection scheme. Besides, a cross-modality graph structured attention (CGSA) is incorporated to improve the global feature learning by utilizing the contextual relation between images from two modalities. This module reduces the negative effects of noisy images. To seamlessly integrate two components, a parameter-free dynamic aggregation strategy is designed in a progressive joint learning manner. To further improve the performance, we additionally design a simple yet effective channel-level learning strategy by exploiting the rich channel information of visible images, which significantly reinforces the performance without modifying the network structure or changing the training process.

On the other hand, malware detection systems based on machine learning techniques started offering a promising alternative to standard approaches, drastically reducing analysis time and turning out to be more robust against evasion and obfuscation techniques. In this paper, we give a semi-supervised malware detection and classification system based on energy. In this system, we have access to only anomaly-free training data and want to detect and identify malware of an arbitrary nature on test data. We employ the density estimates from the energy-based model as normalcy scores that can be used to discriminate normal code from malware ones. Further, we back-propagate the gradients of the energy score with respect to the code in order to generate a gradient map that provides code localization of the malware. To quantitatively validate the performance of the proposed method, We tested the proposed method on the open source dataset, containing approximately 20 thousand PE samples, analyzed through static analysis.

The ARCD approach is based on the differentiation between the predefined standard resource consumption pattern and the anomalous consumption pattern of system resource utilization. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is tested in a rigorous manner by simulating four types of cyberattacks: a denial-of-service attack, a brute-force attack, a remote code execution attack, and a man-in-the-middle attack, which are executed on a Smart PiCar (used as the testbed). A septenary tuple model consisting of seven parameters, representing the embedded system's architecture, has been created as the core of the detection mechanism. The approach's efficiency and effectiveness has been validated in terms of range and pattern by analyzing the collected data statistically in terms of mean, median, mode, standard deviation, range, minimum, and maximum values. The results demonstrated the potential for defining a standard pattern of resource utilization and performance of the embedded system due to a significant similarity of the parameters' values at normal states. In contrast, the attacked cases showed a definite, observable, and detectable impact on resource consumption and performance of the embedded system, causing an anomalous pattern. Thus, by merging these two findings, the ARCD approach has been developed. ARCD facilitates building secure operating systems in line with the ES's capabilities.

Enhancing the Transferability of Adversarial Attacks through Variance Tuning,X. Wang; K.

Though adversarial attacks have achieved incredible success rates in the white-box setting, most existing adversaries often exhibit weak transferability in the black-box setting, especially under the scenario of attacking models with defense mechanisms. In this work, we propose a new method called variance tuning to enhance the class of iterative gradient based attack methods and improve their attack transferability. Specifically, at each iteration for the gradient calculation, instead of directly using the current gradient for the momentum accumulation, we further consider the gradient variance of the previous iteration to tune the current gradient so as to stabilize the update direction and escape from poor local optima. Empirical results on the standard ImageNet dataset demonstrate that our method could significantly improve the transferability of gradient-based adversarial attacks. Besides, our method could be used to attack ensemble models or be integrated with various input transformations. Incorporating variance tuning with input transformations on iterative gradient-based attacks in the multi-model setting, the integrated method could achieve an average success rate of 90.1% against nine advanced defense methods, improving the current best attack performance significantly by 85.1% .

GMSA: Gathering Multiple Signatures Approach to Defend Against Code Injection Attacks,H. Alnabulsi; R. Islam; M.

CIA is a problem which hackers attempt to introduce to any new method, their objective being to bypass the protection system. In this paper, we present a tool called GMSA, developed to detect a variety of CIAs, for example, cross-site scripting (XSS) attack, SQL injection attack, shell injection attack (command injection attack), and file inclusion attack. The latter consists of local file inclusion and remote file inclusion. Our empirical analysis reveals that compared with existing research, gathering multiple signatures approach (GMSA) executes a precision performance (accuracy of the proposed algorithm is 99.45%). The false positive rate (FPR) of GMSA is 0.59%, which is low compared with what other research has reported. The low FPR is the most important factor. Ideally, the defense algorithm should balance between the FPR and true positive rate (TPR) because with existing methodologies, security experts can defend against a broad range of CIAs with uncomplicated security software. Typical protection methods yield a high FPR. Our method results in high TPR while minimizing the resources needed to address the false positive. GMSA can detect four types of CIA.

It is based on two major steps: the feature extraction, which involves the calculation of statistics and information theory properties from a given binary; and the classification, which adopts a decision tree learned from input features of packed and unpacked binaries previously known in order to classify new executables. The results obtained proved the effectiveness of the tool, but the choice of using only one classifier is arguably a weakness that we chose to improve on the present study. For that end, we rebuilt the training and test datasets and selected the following six classifiers to our analyses: classification and regression trees, random forest, k-nearest neighbors, naive Bayes, neural network and support vector machines.

While most existing malware detection systems can be updated by retraining on new applications with true labels, DroidEvolver requires neither retraining nor true labels to update itself, mainly due to the insight that DroidEvolver makes necessary and lightweight update using online learning techniques with evolving feature set and pseudo labels. The detection performance of DroidEvolver is evaluated on a dataset of 33,294 benign applications and 34,722 malicious applications developed over a period of six years.

In healthcare, the collected data can monitor user emotion, behavior, and activity, which leads to the development of personalized decisions and improves lifestyle. In this paper, we analyzed the existing health fog framework and identified its limitations in terms of security, performance, and accuracy. Based on these limitations, we propose a secure health fog (SHF) framework that collects data from different Internet of Things (IoT) devices and maintains a personalized repository for adaptive model tuning. The adaptive model improves periodically based on user feedback and generates a personalized recommendation. Moreover, the existing IoT devices mostly rely on low-cost and low-power Zigbee technology, which is vulnerable to different attacks, such as device control, eavesdropping, fake device injection, malicious insider, man-in-the-middle, masquerading, message tampering, privacy leakage, and replay attack. Therefore, we propose a Zigbee Secure Health Fog (ZigbeeSHF) protocol, which uses symmetric and public-key cryptography to prevent these attacks. For data migration security, we concatenate the encrypted data with the encrypted digital signature to provide data authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality. To support our claims, we use the automated formal verification tools Scyther and AVISPA (Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications), which evaluate the protocols based on the threat model and exploits the vulnerabilities in different attacking environments. The results of both tools ensure prevention against the mentioned attacks. As a proof of concept, we also evaluate the accuracy and performance of our proposed framework in a smart studio apartment. The result shows that the adaptive model tuned for an individual user is very effective, and the average accuracy of 32.5% is improved after one month.

GraphChi is able to execute several advanced data mining, graph mining and machine learning algorithms on very large graphs. With the novel technique of parallel sliding windows (PSW) to load subgraph from disk to memory for vertices and edges updating, it can achieve data processing performance close to and even better than those of mainstream distributed graph engines. GraphChi mentioned that its memory is not effectively utilized with large dataset, which leads to suboptimal computation performances. In this paper we are motivated by the concepts of “pin ” from TurboGraph and “ghost” from GraphLab to propose a new memory utilization mode for GraphChi, which is called Part-in-memory mode, to improve the GraphChi algorithm performance. The main idea is to pin a fixed part of data inside the memory during the whole computing process. Part-in-memory mode is successfully implemented with only about 40 additional lines of code to the original GraphChi engine. Extensive experiments are performed with large real datasets (including Twitter graph with 1.4 billion edges). The preliminary results show that Part-in-memory mode memory management approach effectively reduces the GraphChi running time by up to 60% in PageRank algorithm. Interestingly it is found that a larger portion of data pinned in memory does not always lead to better performance in the case that the whole dataset cannot be fitted in memory.

The vulnerability of DNNs against such attacks can prove a major roadblock towards their real-world deployment. Transferability of adversarial examples demand generalizable defenses that can provide cross-task protection. Adversarial training that enhances robustness by modifying target model's parameters lacks such generalizability. On the other hand, different input processing based defenses fall short in the face of continuously evolving attacks. In this paper, we take the first step to combine the benefits of both approaches and propose a self-supervised adversarial training mechanism in the input space. By design, our defense is a generalizable approach and provides significant robustness against the unseen adversarial attacks (e.g. by reducing the success rate of translation-invariant ensemble attack from 82.6% to 31.9% in comparison to previous stateof-the-art).

A Gibbs sampler generates groups of users according to the posterior probability that these users could have forged the sequence extracted from the pirated content. The marginal probability that a given user pertains to the collusion is then estimated by a Monte Carlo method. The users having the biggest empirical marginal probabilities are accused. This MCMC method can decode any type of fingerprinting codes. This paper is in the spirit of the `Learn and Match' decoding strategy: it assumes that the collusion attack belongs to a family of models. The Expectation-Maximization algorithm estimates the parameters of the collusion model from the extracted sequence. This part of the algorithm is described for the binary Tardos code and with the exploitation of the soft outputs of the watermarking decoder. The experimental body considers some extreme setups where the fingerprinting code lengths are very small. It reveals that the weak link of our approach is the estimation part. This is a clear warning to the `Learn and Match' decoding strategy.,2157-4774,978-1-4673-2287-4,10.1109/WIFS.2012.6412647,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6412647,,Decoding;Watermarking;Markov processes;Estimation;Monte Carlo methods;Joints;Noise,binary codes;computer crime;expectation-maximisation algorithm;learning (artificial intelligence);Markov processes;Monte Carlo methods;probability;watermarking,Markov Chain Monte Carlo method;fingerprinting decoder;MCMC method;Gibbs sampler;posterior probability;sequence extraction;pirated content;empirical marginal probability;fingerprinting code decoding;Learn and Match decoding strategy;collusion attack;expectation-maximization algorithm;parameter estimation;binary Tardos code;watermarking decoder;fingerprinting code length;active fingerprinting;traitor tracing,,7.0,,10.0,IEEE,17 Jan 2013,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,False,True,True,

It leverages the computational power of edge devices (i.e., mobile devices) to train machine learning models with distributed data sets on edge devices without uploading data sets to the cloud. The straightforward benefit is avoiding data security concerns. However, federated learning also encounters challenges, like stragglers (end-devices that respond slowly) among devices due to heterogeneity of devices. Most of the existing body of research tries to address the problem through training objects replication and information coding design such as maximum distance separable (MDS) code. In this paper, we propose a decentralized redundant n-Cayley tree (DRC-tree) for federated learning.

Recent studies show that machine learning using these features is extremely effective and that they achieve almost perfect performance. We perform a detailed analysis to better understand the strong performance of the “Golden Features”. We found that several studies used an experimental procedure that results in data leakage and data duplication, which are subtle issues with significant implications. Firstly, the ground-truth labels have leaked into features that measure the proportion of actionable warnings in a given context. Secondly, many warnings in the testing dataset appear in the training dataset. Next, we demonstrate limitations in the warning oracle that determines the ground-truth labels, a heuristic comparing warnings in a given revision to a reference revision in the future. We show the choice of reference revision influences the warning distribution. Moreover, the heuristic produces labels that do not agree with human oracles. Hence, the strong performance of these techniques previously seen is overoptimistic of their true performance if adopted in practice.

The modern mobile phone technologies make the verification process of CDP easier and available to the end customers.

Defending against such attacks is essential to maintaining the integrity of the software supply chain, but the sheer volume of package updates makes comprehensive manual review infeasible. We present Amalfi, a machine-learning based approach for automatically detecting potentially malicious packages comprised of three complementary techniques. We start with classifiers trained on known examples of malicious and benign packages. If a package is flagged as malicious by a classifier, we then check whether it includes metadata about its source repository, and if so whether the package can be reproduced from its source code. Packages that are reproducible from source are not usually malicious, so this step allows us to weed out false positives. Finally, we also employ a simple textual clone-detection technique to identify copies of malicious packages that may have been missed by the classifiers, reducing the number of false negatives. Amalfi improves on the state of the art in that it is lightweight, requiring only a few seconds per package to extract features and run the classifiers, and gives good results in practice: running it on 96287 package versions published over the course of one week, we were able to identify 95 previously unknown malware samples, with a manageable number of false positives.",1558-1225,978-1-4503-9221-1,10.1145/3510003.3510104,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9793552,supply chain security;malware detection,Training;Supply chains;Ecosystems;Manuals;Static analysis;Syntactics;Feature extraction,computer crime;computer network security;feature extraction;invasive software;learning (artificial intelligence);meta data;security of data;software maintenance;software packages,JavaScript ecosystems;Type-Script ecosystems;million packages;malicious actors;existing packages;package updates;potentially malicious packages;classifier;benign packages;simple textual clone-detection technique;96287 package versions;practical automated detection;malicious npm packages;npm registry,,4.0,,34.0,CCBY,20 Jun 2022,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,False,True,True,

However, the existing attack methods craft the perturbations for each video independently, which comes at a non-negligible computational cost. In this paper, we show the existence of universal perturbations that can enable the targeted attack, e.g., forcing a tracker to follow the ground-truth trajectory with specified offsets, to be video-agnostic and free from inference in a network. Specifically, we attack a tracker by adding a universal translucent perturbation to the template image and adding a fake target, i.e., a small universal adversarial patch, into the search images adhering to the predefined trajectory, so that the tracker outputs the location and size of the fake target instead of the real target. Our approach allows perturbing a novel video to come at no additional cost except the mere addition operations – and not require gradient optimization or network inference. Experimental results on several datasets demonstrate that our approach can effectively fool the Siamese trackers in a targeted attack manner. We show that the proposed perturbations are not only universal across videos, but also generalize well across different trackers. Such perturbations are therefore doubly universal, both with respect to the data and the network architectures.

However, it introduces new hyper-parameters, which not only affects the degree of model sparsity, but also determines whether the model can be effectively trained. So how to automatically select hyper-parameters becomes an important and open problem for regularization-based model compression method. In general, we propose an automatic CNN model compression framework with cross-validation gradient which can automatically adjust the hyper-parameters and combine model parameter learning with hyper-parameter learning together. Specifically, in order to solve the hyper-parameter gradient (cross-validation gradient), we introduce auxiliary variables to transform the non-differentiable problem of L1 norm to a derivable form and obtain the derivative of model parameters with respect to hyper-parameters. Then the cross-validation gradient can be finally solved by the chain rule. Secondly, unlike common cross-validation methods, we propose a alternative learning methods for parameter learning with hyper-parameter learning. It is an unified framework which do not need to training from scratch after each hyper-parameters update which save a lot of time compared with manual parameter adjustment. Thirdly, we do not need to specify the sparsity rate which is also take much time for pruning methods.

Specifically, understanding the latent space of GANs, i.e., obtaining the completely decoupled latent space, is essential for applications in some secure scenarios. At present, there is no quantitative method to measure the decoupling of latent space, which is not conducive to the development of the community. In this article, we propose two methods to measure the sensitivity of latent dimensions: one is a sequential intervention method, and the other is an optimization-based method that measures the sensitivity in both the value and the direction. With these two methods, the decoupling of latent space can be measured by the sparsity of the sensitivity vector obtained.

To mitigate this issue, several potential multiple access (MA) mechanisms including sparse code MA (SCMA) have been proposed. Besides, the short-packet transmission feature of MTC devices requires the design of new transmission and congestion avoidance techniques as the existing techniques based on the assumption of infinite data-packet length may not be suitable for mMTC networks. Therefore, it is important to find novel solutions to address RACH congestion in mMTC networks while considering SCMA and short-packet communications (SPC). In this paper, we propose an SCMA-based random access (RA) method, in which Q-learning is utilized to dynamically allocate the SCMA codebooks and time-slot groups to MTC devices with the aim of minimizing the RACH congestion in SPC-based mMTC networks. To clarify the benefits of our proposed method, we compare its performance with those of the conventional RA methods with/without Q-learning in terms of RA efficiency and evaluate its convergence.

SEI is based on radio frequency (RF) features from circuit difference, rather than cryptography. These features are inherent characteristics of hardware circuits, which are difficult to counterfeit. Recently, various deep learning (DL)-based conventional SEI methods have been proposed, and achieved advanced performances. However, these methods are proposed for close-set scenarios with massive RF signal samples for training, and they generally have poor performance under the condition of limited training samples. Thus, we focus on few-shot SEI (FS-SEI) for aircraft identification via automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) signals, and a novel FS-SEI method is proposed, based on deep metric ensemble learning (DMEL). Specifically, the proposed method consists of feature embedding and classification. The former is based on metric learning with a complex-valued convolutional neural network (CVCNN) for extracting discriminative features with compact intracategory distance and separable intercategory distance, while the latter is realized by an ensemble classifier. Simulation results show that if the number of samples per category is more than 5, the average accuracy of our proposed method is higher than 98%.

Previous approaches tackle this problem by implicit feature interaction and fusion between visual and linguistic modalities in a one-stage manner. However, human tends to solve the referring problem in a progressive manner based on informative words in the expression, i.e., first roughly locating candidate entities and then distinguishing the target one. In this paper, we propose a cross-modal progressive comprehension (CMPC) scheme to effectively mimic human behaviors and implement it as a CMPC-I (Image) module and a CMPC-V (Video) module to improve referring image and video segmentation models. For image data, our CMPC-I module first employs entity and attribute words to perceive all the related entities that might be considered by the expression. Then, the relational words are adopted to highlight the target entity as well as suppress other irrelevant ones by spatial graph reasoning. For video data, our CMPC-V module further exploits action words based on CMPC-I to highlight the correct entity matched with the action cues by temporal graph reasoning. In addition to the CMPC, we also introduce a simple yet effective Text-Guided Feature Exchange (TGFE) module to integrate the reasoned multimodal features corresponding to different levels in the visual backbone under the guidance of textual information. In this way, multi-level features can communicate with each other and be mutually refined based on the textual context.

Hsu,"Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan Normal University, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan Normal University, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan Normal University, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan Normal University, Taipei, Taiwan",IEEE Access,31 Mar 2021,2021.0,9,,35313,35323,"Since deep neural networks may classify out-of-distribution image data into in-distribution classes with high confidence scores, this problem may cause serious or even fatal hazards in certain applications, such as autonomous vehicles and medical diagnosis. Therefore, out-of-distribution detection (also called anomaly detection or outlier detection) of image classification has become a critical issue for the successful development of neural networks. In other words, a successful neural network needs to be able to distinguish anomalous data that is significantly different from the data used in training. In this paper, we propose an efficient data augmentation network to detect out-of-distribution image data by introducing a set of common geometric operations into training and testing images. The output predicted probabilities of the augmented data are combined by an aggregation function to provide a confidence score to distinguish between in-distribution and out-of-distribution image data. Different from other approaches that use out-of-distribution image data for training networks, we only use in-distribution image data in the proposed data augmentation network. This advantage makes our approach more practical than other approaches, and can be easily applied to various neural networks to improve security in practical applications. The experimental results show that the proposed data augmentation network outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in various datasets. In addition, pre-training techniques can be integrated into the data augmentation network to make substantial improvements to large and complex data sets.

Due to the potential for data theft that mobile phone users face, the detection of malware on Android devices has become an increasingly important issue for the field of cyber security. Traditional methods like signature-based routines are unable to protect users from the ever-increasing sophistication and rapid behavior changes in new types of Android malware. Therefore, a great deal of effort has been made recently to use machine learning models and methods to characterize and generalize the malicious behavior patterns of mobile apps for malware detection. In this paper, we propose a novel and highly reliable classifier for Android Malware detection based on a Factorization Machine architecture and the extraction of Android app features from manifest files and source code. Our results indicate that the numerical feature representation of an app typically results in a long and highly sparse vector and that the interactions among different features are critical to revealing malicious behavior patterns.

The semantic features are used as the component of feature vectors. And also the syntactic and semantic features are used to generate multi — dimensional sequences.

Based on TMAC and time synchronization technique, a joint detection is implemented to resist pollution attacks and replay attacks synchronously. The correctness of the detection service is proved.

Most previous methods adopt Projected Gradient Decent (PGD) with manually specifying attack parameters for AE generation. A combination of the attack parameters can be referred to as an attack strategy. Several works have revealed that using a fixed attack strategy to generate AEs during the whole training phase limits the model robustness and propose to exploit different attack strategies at different training stages to improve robustness. But those multi-stage handcrafted attack strategies need much domain expertise, and the robustness improvement is limited. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for adversarial training by introducing the concept of “learnable attack strategy”, dubbed LAS-AT, which learns to automatically produce attack strategies to improve the model robustness. Our framework is composed of a target network that uses AEs for training to improve robustness, and a strategy network that produces attack strategies to control the AE generation.

One popular approach for physical-world attacks is to adopt the “sticker-pasting” strategy, which however suffers from some limitations, including difficulties in access to the target or printing by valid colors. A new type of non-invasive attacks emerged recently, which attempt to cast perturbation onto the target by optics based tools, such as laser beam and projector. However, the added optical patterns are artificial but not natural. Thus, they are still conspicuous and attention-grabbed, and can be easily noticed by humans. In this paper, we study a new type of optical adversarial examples, in which the perturbations are generated by a very common natural phenomenon, shadow, to achieve naturalistic and stealthy physical-world adversarial attack under the black-box setting. We extensively evaluate the effectiveness of this new attack on both simulated and real-world environments. Experimental results on traffic sign recognition demonstrate that our algorithm can generate adversarial examples effectively, reaching 98.23% and 90.47% success rates on LISA and GTSRB test sets respectively, while continuously misleading a moving camera over 95% of the time in real-world scenarios.

Targeted malware is a recent type of threat, involving bespoke software that has been created to target a specific victim. It is considered a more dangerous threat than generic malware, because a targeted attack can cause more serious damage to the victim. Our work aims to automatically distinguish between the network activity generated by the two types of malware, which then allows samples of malware to be classified as being either targeted or generic. For a network administrator, such knowledge can be important because it assists to understand which threats require particular attention. Because a network administrator usually manages more than an alarm simultaneously, the aim of the work is particularly relevant. We set up a sandbox and infected virtual machines with malware, recording all resulting malware activity on the network. Using the network packets produced by the malware samples, we extract features to classify their behavior. Before performing classification, we carefully analyze the features and the dataset to study all their details and gain a deeper understanding of the malware under study.

However, it is challenging to design a representation learning method for heterogeneous information networks (HINs) due to their diversity. Most of the existing HIN-oriented learning methods define a series of meta-paths. Then, they aggregate the representations learned from different meta-paths in the same hidden space. These methods do not consider semantic differences of different meta-paths, which leads to semantic confusion. And further affects the effectiveness of the learned representation. Given these issues, we introduce a Semantic Aware HIN Representation learning Network (SAHRN), which takes into account the semantics of different meta-paths. We mitigate the problem of semantic confusion by projecting nodes’ features into different hidden spaces separately according to different meta-paths. To further expand the scope of aggregation and enrich the aggregated information, we also design various variants of our model by adding layer aggregation.

However, the images of different vehicles may have small visual discrepancies when they have the same/similar attributes, e.g., the same/similar color, type, and manufacturer. Meanwhile, the images from a vehicle may have large visual discrepancies with different states, e.g., different camera views, vehicle viewpoints, and capture time. In this paper, we propose an attribute and state guided structural embedding network (ASSEN) to achieve discriminative feature learning by attribute-based enhancement and state-based weakening for vehicle Re-ID. First, we propose an attribute-based enhancement and expanding module to enhance the discrimination of vehicle features through identity-related attribute information, and we design an attribute-based expanding loss to increase the feature gap between different vehicles. Second, we design a state-based weakening and shrinking module, which not only weakens the state information that interferes with identification but also reduces the intra-class feature gap by a state-based shrinking loss. Third, we propose a global structural embedding module that exploits the attribute information and state information to explore hierarchical relationships between vehicle features, then we use these relationships for feature embedding to learn more robust vehicle features. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets VeRi-776, VehicleID, and VERI-Wild demonstrate the superior performance and generalization of the proposed method against state-of-the-art vehicle Re-ID methods.

Deep text understandings and effective learning of diagram semantics are important for this task due to its specificity. In this paper, we propose a Weakly Supervised learning method for TQA (WSTQ), which regards the incompletely accurate results of essential intermediate procedures for this task as supervision to develop Text Matching (TM) and Relation Detection (RD) tasks and then employs the tasks to motivate itself to learn strong text comprehension and excellent diagram semantics respectively. Specifically, we apply the result of text retrieval to build positive as well as negative text pairs. In order to learn deep text understandings, we first pre-train the text understanding module of WSTQ on TM and then fine-tune it on TQA. We build positive as well as negative relation pairs by checking whether there is any overlap between the items/regions detected from diagrams using object detection. The RD task forces our method to learn the relationships between regions, which are crucial to express the diagram semantics. We train WSTQ on RD and TQA simultaneously, i.e., multitask learning, to obtain effective diagram semantics and then improve the TQA performance. Extensive experiments are carried out on CK12-QA and AI2D to verify the effectiveness of WSTQ.

The design of embedded systems requires a good trade off between performance and code size due to the limited amount of available resources. We show that such convolutional neural network can efficiently avoid any floating-point computation without any loss in performance.

However, the stability of DARTS is very inferior, especially skip connections aggregation that leads to performance collapse. Though existing methods leverage Hessian eigenvalues to alleviate skip connections aggregation, they make DARTS unable to explore architectures with better performance. In the paper, we propose operation-level progressive differentiable neural architecture search (OPP-DARTS) to avoid skip connections aggregation and explore better architectures simultaneously. We first divide the search process into several stages during the search phase and increase candidate operations into the search space progressively at the beginning of each stage. It can effectively alleviate the unfair competition between operations during the search phase of DARTS by offsetting the inherent unfair advantage of the skip connection over other operations. Besides, to keep the competition between operations relatively fair and select the operation from the candidate operations set that makes training loss of the supernet largest. The experiment results indicate that our method is effective and efficient. Our method’s performance on CIFAR-10 is superior to the architecture found by standard DARTS, and the transferability of our method also surpasses standard DARTS.

RD performs in a meta-learning way to obtain a learning ability to filter the distractors from the background while RM aims to effectively integrate the proposed RD into the Siamese framework to generate accurate tracking result.

The Pyramid Spatial Parsing (PSP) module has shown superior performances in scene and human parsing tasks. However, the basic AvgPool operation in PSP equally aggregates spatial clues of a local region, and thus mixes up influences of different human parts presented in this region. It results in failures in capturing useful contexts relevant to parsing different parts. To address this problem, a suitable mechanism to collect spatial clues aligning with different human parts is proposed in this paper. We employ a Gather-Excite (GE) operation, a replacement of the AvgPool-Upsample operation in a pyramidical structure, to accurately reflect relevant human parts of various scales. The GE operation contains two steps: the gather operation that adaptively aggregates spatial clues to relevant human parts, and the excite operation that generates new feature maps with the gathered contextual information. This results in a novel Pyramidical Gather-Excite Context (PGEC) module to solve the multi-scale problem and parse person at various scales. The PGEC module is composed of multiple GE operations with different spatial extents and aggregates local and global spatial clues for better modeling multi-scale contextual information in parallel. Moreover, we integrate the PGEC module with fine-grained details, edge preserving module and deep supervision to formulate a novel PGEC Network (PGECNet) for human parsing. The proposed PGECNet has achieved state-of-the-art performance on four single-person human parsing datasets (i.e., LIP, PPSS, ATR and Fashion Clothing) and two multi-person human parsing datasets (i.e., PASCAL-Person-Part and CIHP).

How to construct vision-relevant and explainable multimodal knowledge for the VQA scenario has been less studied. In this paper, we propose MuKEA to represent multimodal knowledge by an explicit triplet to correlate visual objects and fact answers with implicit relations. To bridge the heterogeneous gap, we propose three objective losses to learn the triplet representations from complementary views: embedding structure, topological relation and semantic space. By adopting a pretraining and fine-tuning learning strategy, both basic and domain-specific multimodal knowledge are progressively accumulated for answer prediction. We outperform the state-of-the-art by 3.35% and 6.08% respectively on two challenging knowledge-required datasets: OK-VQA and KRVQA.

Therefore, this method can capture the potential correlations between different modalities and within the same modality, so as to make up for the differences between different modalities and within the same modality.

AdGraph: A Graph-Based Approach to Ad and Tracker Blocking,U. Iqbal; P. Snyder; S. Zhu; B. Livshits; Z. Qian; Z.

Existing tools, both deployed and described in research, have proven useful, but lack either the completeness or robustness needed for a general solution. Existing detection approaches generally focus on only one aspect of advertising or tracking (e.g. URL patterns, code structure), making existing approaches susceptible to evasion.In this work we present AdGraph, a novel graph-based machine learning approach for detecting advertising and tracking resources on the web. AdGraph differs from existing approaches by building a graph representation of the HTML structure, network requests, and JavaScript behavior of a webpage, and using this unique representation to train a classifier for identifying advertising and tracking resources. Because AdGraph considers many aspects of the context a network request takes place in, it is less susceptible to the single-factor evasion techniques that flummox existing approaches.We evaluate AdGraph on the Alexa top-10K websites, and find that it is highly accurate, able to replicate the labels of human-generated filter lists with 95.33% accuracy, and can even identify many mistakes in filter lists. We implement AdGraph as a modification to Chromium. AdGraph adds only minor overhead to page loading and execution, and is actually faster than stock Chromium on 42% of websites and AdBlock Plus on 78% of websites. Overall, we conclude that AdGraph is both accurate enough and performant enough for online use, breaking comparable or fewer websites than popular filter list based approaches.",2375-1207,978-1-7281-3497-0,10.1109/SP40000.2020.00005,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9152669,,Advertising;Chromium;Uniform resource locators;Browsers;Privacy;Tools;Robustness,graph theory;Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;Web sites,AdGraph;tracking resources;machine learning approach;graph representation;network request;code structure;filter list based approaches;tracker blocking;ad blocking;HTML structure;network requests;JavaScript behavior;webpage,,22.0,,65.0,IEEE,30 Jul 2020,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,False,True,True,

Web applications have opened up a variety of market possibilities by supplying consumers with a wide variety of digital technologies that benefit from high accessibility and functionality. Around the same time, web application protection continues to be an important challenge on the internet, and security must be taken seriously in order to secure confidential data. The threat is caused by inadequate validation of user input information, software developed without strict adherence to safety standards, vulnerability of reusable software libraries, software weakness, and so on. Through abusing a website's vulnerability, introduers are manipulating the user's information in order to exploit it for their own benefit. Then introduers inject their own malicious code, stealing passwords, manipulating user activities, and infringing on customers' privacy. As a result, information is leaked, applications malfunction, confidential data is accessed, etc. To mitigate the aforementioned issues, stacking ensemble based classifier model for Cross-site scripting (XSS) attack detection is proposed. Furthermore, the stacking ensembles technique is used in combination with different machine learning classification algorithms like k-Means, Random Forest and Decision Tree as base-learners to reliably detect XSS attack. Logistic Regression is used as meta-learner to predict the attack with greater accuracy. The classification algorithms in stacking model explore the problem in their own way and its results are given as input to the meta-learner to make final prediction, thus improving the overall detection accuracy of XSS attack in stacking than the individual models.

This problem is especially challenging in the world of network intrusion detection. In this realm, we must not only deal with sifting through vast amounts of data, but we must also do it in a timely manner even when at times we are not sure what exactly it is we are trying to find. In the grander scheme of our work we intend to demonstrate that several different data mining algorithms reporting to an overarching layer will yield more accurate results than anyone data mining application (or algorithm) acting on its own. The system will operate in the domain of offline network and computer forensic data mining, under the guidance of a hybrid intelligence/multi-agent, systems based, for interpretation and interpolation of the findings. Toward that end, in this paper we build upon earlier work, undertaking the steps required for generating and preparing suitably minable data. Specifically, we are concerned with extracting as much useful data as possible out of a PCAP (Packet capture) for importing into Weka. While a PCAP may have thousands of field/value pairs, Wireshark and tshark's csv (comma separated value) output module only renders a small percentage of these fields and their values by default.

More importantly, to unify both additive and non-additive perturbations, we propose a novel unified yet flexible framework for universal adversarial attacks, called GUAP, which is able to initiate attacks by additive perturbation, non-additive perturbation, or the combination of both. Extensive experiments are conducted on ImageNet dataset with several deep neural network models including GoogLeNet, VGG and ResNet.

In this paper we create a featured data set from program traces at run time, either during its regular life, or during its testing phase. This data set represents execution traces of relevant variables including inputs, outputs, intermediate variables, and invariant checks. During a learning mining step, we start from exhaustive random training input sets and map program traces to a minimal set of conceptual patterns. We employ formal concept analysis to do this in an incremental way, and without losing dependencies between data set features. This set of patterns becomes a reference for checking the normality of future program executions as it captures invariant functional dependencies between the variables that need to be preserved during execution. During the learning step, we consider enough input classes corresponding to the different patterns by using random input selection until reaching stability of the set of patterns (i.e. the set is almost no longer changing, and only negligible new patterns are not reducible to it). Experimental results show that the generated patterns are significant in representing normal program executions.

Recent literature approaches are based on Deep Learning (DL) models. Efficient models are required for hardware-constrained systems, such as mobile devices, embedded systems, and robotics achieving high performance at low power consumption. For this research, we designed a novel specific-purpose model for fire and smoke recognition using still images and the study of state-of-the-art convolution techniques to improve the trade-off between accuracy and complexity. In this regard, the literature suggests that the inverted residual block, the depthwise and octave convolution techniques, reduces the model’s size and computation requirements working well by themselves. In this work, we propose the KutralNext architecture, an efficient model for single- and multi-label fire and smoke recognition tasks. Additionally, a more efficient architecture KutralNext+, demonstrates that those convolution techniques achieve a better trade-off combined, reaching an 84.36% average test accuracy in FireNet, FiSmo, and FiSmoA fire datasets. The KutralSmoke and FiSmo fire and smoke datasets attained an 81.53% average test accuracy.

Signature detection methods have been unable to cope with the onslaught of new binaries aided by rapidly developing obfuscation techniques. Recent research has focused on the analysis of low-level opcodes, both static and dynamic, as a way to detect malware. Although sometimes successful at detecting malware, static analysis still fails to unravel obfuscated code, whereas dynamic analysis can allow researchers to investigate the revealed code at runtime. Research in the field has been limited by the underpinning data sets; old and inadequately sampled malware can lessen the extrapolation potential of such data sets. The main contribution of this paper is the creation of a new parsed runtime trace data set of over 100 000 labeled samples, which will address these shortcomings, and we offer the data set itself for use by the wider research community. This data set underpins the examination of the run traces using classifiers on count-based and sequence-based data. We find that malware detection rates are lessened when samples are labeled with traditional anti-virus (AV) labels. Neither count-based nor sequence-based algorithms can sufficiently distinguish between AV label classes. Detection increases when malware is re-classed with labels yielded from unsupervised learning. With sequenced-based learning, detection exceeds that of labeling as simply “malware”alone.

In the era of big data, data-processing software with many users is more concerned by hackers. It is essential to improve the efficiency of discovering vulnerabilities in data-processing software. We noticed that in the process of discovering vulnerabilities, some problems of existing technology such as fuzzing, symbolic execution, and taint analysis have more or fewer relationships with data-processing functions. In fuzzing, there are two types of sanity checks toward the target program: NCC (Non-critical check) and CC (critical check). It is usually challenging to bypass such a sanity check, which leads to low code coverage during fuzzing. In symbolic execution, the constraint solver still has the problem of trying to deal with the constraints of complex algorithms. In taint analysis, the problem of over-taint and under-taint is always the key to affect the accuracy of the results. Therefore, to solve the above problems, it is necessary to identify the data-processing function. Based on identifying data-processing functions, we could identify those sanity checks, ease the solution of complex constraints, and understand the way of taints propagation to assist in software vulnerability discovery and analysis. This paper proposed a method called DPFI(data-processing function identification) for identifying data-processing functions with deep neural networks. We collected 37000 functions from GitHub and implemented the method on the data set with several neural networks, among which the performance of CNN achieved best and F1-score was 0.90. We then applied the trained model on CGC(cyber grand challenge) data and real softwares for testing.

The PalmCohashNet comprises two hashing subnetworks, one for each palm modality, and is trained collaboratively to generate shared hash codes for respective modality (co-hash codes). A cross-modality hashing (CMH) loss is devised to encourage co-hash codes of palm vein and palm print from the same identity to be adjacent and consistent; meanwhile, pull the co-hash codes of each identity to a preassigned identity-specific hash centroid that is shared by both palm modalities. Two palm-based co-hash codes of a person can be generated simultaneously for deployment. The binary co-hash code is IoT compliant attributed to its highly compact form for storage and fast matching. A trained PalmCohashNet can be flexibly deployed under four operation modes: single-modality matching (print versus print or vein versus vein), multimodality matching where both print and vein are utilized, and cross-modality matching (print versus vein) depending on the IoT service context.

(CyCon),4 Jul 2022,2022.0,700,,385,403,"Cyber threat intelligence (CTI) has become a critical component of the defense of organizations against the steady surge of cyber attacks. Malware is one of the most challenging problems for CTI, due to its prevalence, the massive number of variants, and the constantly changing threat actor behaviors. Currently, Malpedia has indexed 2,390 unique malware families, while the AVTEST Institute has recorded more than 166 million new unique malware samples in 2021. There exists a vast number of variants per malware family. Consequently, the signature-based representation of patterns and knowledge of legacy systems can no longer be generalized to detect future malware attacks. Machine learning-based solutions can match more variants. However, as a black-box approach, they lack the explainability and maintainability required by incident response teams.There is thus an urgent need for a data-driven system that can abstract a future-proof, human-friendly, systematic, actionable, and dependable knowledge representation from software artifacts from the past for more effective and insightful malware triage. In this paper, we present the first phenotype-based malware decomposition system for quick malware triage that is effective against malware variants. We define phenotypes as directly observable characteristics such as code fragments, constants, functions, and strings. Malware development rarely starts from scratch, and there are many reused components and code fragments. The target under investigation is decomposed into known phenotypes that are mapped to known malware families, malware behaviors, and Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups.

The code of normal sample obtained through the trained encoder can get a larger probability value when passing through the trained kernel density estimator, while the code of anomalous sample can get a smaller probability value, so as to achieve the purpose of anomaly detection.

However, since most real-world solutions are trained by private data and released as black-box services on the cloud, we should investigate their robustness in the black-box setting. Unfortunately, existing work ignores to consider the uniqueness of electronic health records (EHRs). To fill this gap, we propose the first black-box adversarial attack method against health risk prediction models named MedAttacker to investigate their vulnerability. It addresses the challenges brought by EHRs via two steps: hierarchical position selection which selects the attacked positions in a reinforcement learning (RL) framework and substitute selection which identifies substitutes with a score-based principle. Particularly, by considering the temporal context inside EHRs, MedAttacker initializes its RL position selection policy by using the contribution score of each visit and the saliency score of each code, which can be well integrated with the deterministic substitute selection process decided by the score changes. We evaluate MedAttacker by attacking three advanced risk prediction models in the black-box setting across multiple real-world datasets, and MedAttacker consistently achieves the highest average success rate and even outperforms a recent white-box EHR adversarial attack technique in certain cases.",,978-1-6654-6819-0,10.1109/BIBM55620.2022.9994898,National Science Foundation; ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9994898,,Electronic equipment;Flight recording;Neural networks;Stochastic processes;Reinforcement learning;Medical services;Predictive models,computer crime;deep learning (artificial intelligence);electronic health records;health care;reinforcement learning,advanced risk prediction models;black-box adversarial attacks;black-box services;deep neural networks;deterministic substitute selection process;electronic health records;health care;health risk prediction models;hierarchical position selection;MedAttacker;reinforcement learning;RL position selection policy;score-based principle;white-box EHR adversarial attack technique,,,,12.0,IEEE,2 Jan 2023,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,False,True,True,

Multifamily Classification of Android Malware With a Fuzzy Strategy to Resist Polymorphic Familial Variants,X. Liu; X. Du; Q. Lei; K.

This problem is believed to be much more significant than the binary classification (simply identify a sample as malicious or benign) because it is able to reveal the behaviour patterns of multiple malware families and bring deep insights into the working mechanism of malicious payload. The main challenges of the multifamily classification involve two aspects: recognizing the behaviour patterns of malware families as well as addressing the issues of code obfuscation and polymorphic variants that are commonly used by adversaries to evade rigorous detections. To address these challenges, in this article, we utilize the regular expressions of callbacks to describe the behaviour patterns of malware families, and propose a two-step fuzzy processing strategy to resist potential polymorphic familial variants. The alphabet of such regular expressions only consists of security-sensitive API calls, this enables the regular expressions to resist various kinds of code obfuscation and metamorphism. The proposed fuzzy strategy, applied to the regular expressions, comprises two steps: the first step transforms an original regular expression to such a fuzzy regular expression that possesses a broader meaning than the original one; the second step further relaxes precise plaintext match between two regular expressions to a fuzzy match by introducing the notion of similarity of regular expressions. Applying this strategy promotes the abstract level of a regular expression and enables the behaviour pattern specified by the regular expression to be more resilient to code obfuscation and polymorphic variants. Furthermore, selecting the fuzzy regular expressions as features, we use text mining techniques to train a multifamily 1-NN classifier over 3270 samples of 65 families.

To improve the noise robustness, we try to integrate CNNs with wavelet by replacing the common down-sampling (max-pooling, strided-convolution, and average pooling) with discrete wavelet transform (DWT). We firstly propose general DWT and inverse DWT (IDWT) layers applicable to various orthogonal and biorthogonal discrete wavelets like Haar, Daubechies, and Cohen, etc., and then design wavelet integrated CNNs (WaveCNets) by integrating DWT into the commonly used CNNs (VGG, ResNets, and DenseNet). During the down-sampling, WaveCNets apply DWT to decompose the feature maps into the low-frequency and high-frequency components. Containing the main information including the basic object structures, the low-frequency component is transmitted into the following layers to generate robust high-level features. The high-frequency components are dropped to remove most of the data noises. The experimental results show that WaveCNets achieve higher accuracy on ImageNet than various vanilla CNNs. We have also tested the performance of WaveCNets on the noisy version of ImageNet, ImageNet-C and six adversarial attacks, the results suggest that the proposed DWT/IDWT layers could provide better noise-robustness and adversarial robustness. When applying WaveCNets as backbones, the performance of object detectors (i.e., faster R-CNN and RetinaNet) on COCO detection dataset are consistently improved. We believe that suppression of aliasing effect, i.e. separation of low frequency and high frequency information, is the main advantages of our approach.

Modeling hardware at the electronic system level (ESL) is one way to address this demand, with the C++-based system modeling framework SystemC and its abstract communication library transaction level modeling (TLM) having become de-facto standards for ESL system design. While the C++ compiler is sufficient to compile and simulate a given ESL design, for tasks of design understanding, debugging, or validation (where access to the details of design's structure and behavior is necessarily required), design needs to be processed by an appropriate tool.

This paper introduces an approach that automatically extracts information about both, structure and behavior of SystemC designs and TLM transactions, nonintrusively.

Traditional white-box-based anomaly detection methods need to provide system source code and cannot effectively detect abnormal behaviors that occur when the program is running. Black-box-based anomaly detection methods rely on test cases and have low code coverage. Anomaly detection based on the logs generated during system operation can alleviate the abovementioned problems. However, the existing system log-based abnormality detection method mainly extracts log template characteristics, and cannot effectively determine the logical and temporal abnormalities related to the log. Therefore, in order to detect anomalies in the log sequence more comprehensively, this paper proposes an anomaly detection method based on BiLSTM. This method combines the semantic and temporal characteristics of the log for modeling. In terms of semantics, the Bert natural language processing model is used to extract the contextual semantic information of the logs; in terms of time, the log time interval characteristics are extracted based on the three potential relationships of the logs. In addition, the proposed method also adds an attention mechanism to balance feature weights. Finally, we evaluate our method in experiments on two real datasets, HDFS and OpenStack.

Before operationalizing a drone in IoD, a control infrastructure is mandatory for securing its open network channel (Flying Ad Hoc Networks FANETs). An attacker can easily capture data from the available network channel and use it for their own purpose. Its protection is challenging, as it guarantees message integrity, non-repudiation, authenticity, and authorization amongst all the participants.

This research focus on the security of the communication path between drone and ground station and solving the noted vulnerabilities like stolen-verifier, privileged-insider attacks, and outdated-data-transmission/design flaws often reported in the current authentication protocols for IoD.

Considering that relevant samples from different modalities have semantic correlations, JDSC projects the raw data into a shared space in which the distance of the between-class is maximized and the distance of the within-class is minimized, at the same time, the correlation among the inter-modality of the within-class is maximized.

In the black-box setting, current model stealing attacks train a substitute model to counterfeit the functionality of the target model. However, the training requires querying the target model. Consequently, the query complexity remains high, and such attacks can be defended easily. This study aims to train a generalized substitute model called ""Simulator"", which can mimic the functionality of any unknown target model. To this end, we build the training data with the form of multiple tasks by collecting query sequences generated during the attacks of various existing networks. The learning process uses a mean square error-based knowledge-distillation loss in the meta-learning to minimize the difference between the Simulator and the sampled networks. The meta-gradients of this loss are then computed and accumulated from multiple tasks to update the Simulator and subsequently improve generalization. When attacking a target model that is unseen in training, the trained Simulator can accurately simulate its functionality using its limited feedback. As a result, a large fraction of queries can be transferred to the Simulator, thereby reducing query complexity. Results of the comprehensive experiments conducted using the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach reduces query complexity by several orders of magnitude compared to the baseline method.

One direction of research consists in implementing those candidates on embedded systems and that exposes them to physical attacks in return. The Classic McEliece cryptosystem, which is among the four finalists of round 3 in the Key Encapsulation Mechanism category, builds its security on the hardness of the syndrome decoding problem, which is a classic hard problem in code-based cryptography. This cryptosystem was recently targeted by a laser fault injection attack leading to message recovery. Regrettably, the attack setting is very restrictive and it does not tolerate any error in the faulty syndrome. Moreover, it depends on the very strong attacker model of laser fault injection, and does not apply to optimised implementations of the algorithm that make optimal usage of the machine words capacity.

This is done by leveraging classic machine learning techniques that recover the Hamming weight information very accurately.

To tackle these issues, we formulate the learning of similarity-preserving hash codes in terms of orthogonally rotating the semantic data, so as to minimize the quantization loss of mapping such data to hamming space and propose an efficient fast discriminative discrete hashing (FDDH) approach for large-scale cross-modal retrieval. More specifically, FDDH introduces an orthogonal basis to regress the targeted hash codes of training examples to their corresponding semantic labels and utilizes the  $\varepsilon $ -dragging technique to provide provable large semantic margins. Accordingly, the discriminative power of semantic information can be explicitly captured and maximized. Moreover, an orthogonal transformation scheme is further proposed to map the nonlinear embedding data into the semantic subspace, which can well guarantee the semantic consistency between the data feature and its semantic representation. Consequently, an efficient closed-form solution is derived for discriminative hash code learning, which is very computationally efficient. In addition, an effective and stable online learning strategy is presented for optimizing modality-specific projection functions, featuring adaptivity to different training sizes and streaming data. The proposed FDDH approach theoretically approximates the bi-Lipschitz continuity, runs sufficiently fast, and also significantly improves the retrieval performance over the state-of-the-art methods.

Heterogeneous computing has become a mainstream direction for improving computing power due to its excellent performance and flexible structure. However, it also requires a lot of optimization from the algorithm to the hardware structure to perform large scale operations under low power conditions. In order to solve the above problems, this paper proposes a flexible optimization and implementation based on intra-chip heterogeneous. First, we divide tasks and assign code segments of the same operation to the same subtask. Secondly, according to the requirements of subtasks, a reusable and configurable acceleration kernel is developed in the FPGA, which has high multiplexing rate and flexibility. In addition, the performance and power consumption of the core is improved by optimizing the memory access and interface communication.

In practical communication scenarios, multistage signal processing schemes are usually used, including scrambling, coding, modulation, etc. However, most prior researches on blind recognition only focus on the scenario where the single signal processing method is applied, and it is impractical. In this paper, a blind recognition algorithm based on the characteristics of signal matrix and layered neural network for scrambled channel encoder is proposed. First, this method analyzes the difference between the matrix features in different types of scrambled channel encoders and regards it as an important condition for recognition. Then, the convolutional neural network is used to learn the scrambled codes and classify the different encoder types.

This success increases their vulnerability to attacks that need to be addressed with more sophisticated methods. In this paper we propose to strengthen face liveness detection models, based on photoplethysmography (rPPG) estimated pulses, by learning to generate high-quality, yet fake pulse signals, using Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial networks (DCGANs). The simulated liveness signals are then used to improve detectors by providing it with a better coverage of potential attack-originated signals, during the training stage. Thus, our DCGAN is trained to simulate real pulse signals, leading to sophisticated attacks based on high-quality fake pulses. The full liveness detection framework then leverages on these signals to assess the genuineness of pulse signals in a robust manner at test-time. Experiments confirm that this strategy leads to significant robustness improvements, with relative AUC gains > 3.6%.

Threat models for these demonstrations are limited to (1) targeted attacks through real-time manipulation of the agent's observation, and (2) untargeted attacks through manipulation of the physical environment. The former assumes full access to the agent's states/observations at all times, while the latter has no control over attack outcomes. This paper investigates the feasibility of targeted attacks through visually learned patterns placed on physical objects in the environment, a threat model that combines the practicality and effectiveness of the existing ones. Through analysis, we demonstrate that a pre-trained policy can be hijacked within a time window, e.g., performing an unintended self-parking, when an adversarial object is present. To enable the attack, we adopt an assumption that the dynamics of both the environment and the agent can be learned by the attacker.

One of the methods malware writers use for hiding their creations is executable packing. Packing consists of encrypting or hiding the real code of the executable in such a way that it is decrypted or unhidden in its execution. Widespread solutions to this issue first try to identify the packer used and next apply the corresponding unpacking routine for each packing algorithm. As it happens with malware obfuscations, this approach fails to detect new and custom packers. Generic unpacking is a technique that has been proposed to solve this issue. These methods usually execute the binary in a contained environment or sandbox to retrieve the real code of the packed executable. Because these approaches incur in a high performance overhead, a filter step is required to determine whether an executable is packed or not. Supervised machine-learning approaches have been proposed to handle this filtering step. However, the usefulness of supervised learning is far to be complete because it requires a high amount of packed and not packed executables to be identified and labelled previously.

However, previous solutions extract features from different aspects respectively, ignore the inherent relational and logical information among these features. In this paper, we propose IARNet, an Information Aggregating and Reasoning Network over heterogeneous graph for fake news detection, which exploits the interaction between information to aggregate multi-type information and grasps the inherent relationship simultaneously. Firstly, we construct a heterogeneous graph which takes source post, comments, and users as nodes and the interaction between them as edges. Then, a two-level attention mechanism is applied at the node level and type level. Specifically, the node-level attention aims to learn the importance between a node and its specific edge based neighbors, while the type-level attention aims to learn the importance of different types of edges. With the two-level attention mechanism, IARNet can aggregate multi-type information in a hierarchical manner and the information can reason over heterogeneous graph for the facticity of the news.

Random-based testing tools are time-consuming and model-based testing tools are unrealistic to construct all functional behaviors precisely. Existing testing tools based on reinforcement learning not only have difficulty in understanding the business logic of an application, but also face the problem of state explosion during testing. In this paper, we propose SQDroid, a semantic-driven approach for Android apps based Q-learning. SQDroid encourages the Q-learning agent to prefer the actions with functional semantics through a dynamic semantic reward function, which is beneficial to the understand business logic of an app. A state clustering module, employed to compress the state space in Q-table, utilizes the widget attributes on GUI hierarchy to abstract a state. It can reduce the number of states in Q-table and avoid the execution of repetitive actions. We evaluate SQDroid on 48 open-source Android apps.

While DNN-powered object detection systems celebrate many life-enriching opportunities, they also open doors for misuse and abuse. This paper presents a suite of adversarial objectness gradient attacks, coined as TOG, which can cause the state-of-the-art deep object detection networks to suffer from untargeted random attacks or even targeted attacks with three types of specificity: (1) object-vanishing, (2) object-fabrication, and (3) object-mislabeling. Apart from tailoring an adversarial perturbation for each input image, we further demonstrate TOG as a universal attack, which trains a single adversarial perturbation that can be generalized to effectively craft an unseen input with a negligible attack time cost. Also, we apply TOG as an adversarial patch attack, a form of physical attacks, showing its ability to optimize a visually confined patch filled with malicious patterns, deceiving well-trained object detectors to misbehave purposefully. We report our experimental measurements using three benchmark datasets (PASCAL VOC, MS COCO, and INRIA) on models from three dominant detection algorithms (YOLOv3, SSD, and Faster R-CNN).

We propose a new approach that allows regular programmers to find API misuses. Our approach interacts with the user to classify valid and invalid usages of each target API method.

Since such approaches depend on specific feature extraction tools, machine learning classifiers have to be custom-tailored to effectively build most accurate models.

By naturally combining two recently rising techniques: active learning (AL) and self-paced learning (SPL), our framework is capable of automatically annotating new instances and incorporating them into training under weak expert recertification. We first initialize the classifier using a few annotated samples for each individual, and extract image features using the convolutional neural nets. Then, a number of candidates are selected from the unannotated samples for classifier updating, in which we apply the current classifiers ranking the samples by the prediction confidence. In particular, our approach utilizes the high-confidence and low-confidence samples in the self-paced and the active user-query way, respectively. The neural nets are later fine-tuned based on the updated classifiers. Such heuristic implementation is formulated as solving a concise active SPL optimization problem, which also advances the SPL development by supplementing a rational dynamic curriculum constraint. The new model finely accords with the “instructor-student-collaborative” learning mode in human education. The advantages of this proposed framework are two-folds: i) The required number of annotated samples is significantly decreased while the comparable performance is guaranteed. A dramatic reduction of user effort is also achieved over other state-of-the-art active learning techniques. ii) The mixture of SPL and AL effectively improves not only the classifier accuracy compared to existing AL/SPL methods but also the robustness against noisy data. We evaluate our framework on two challenging datasets, which include hundreds of persons under diverse conditions, and demonstrate very promising results.

Unfortunately, there is no practical way to fully guarantee that an authorization bug will never be introduced-even with good engineering practices-as a web application and its data model become more complex. Unlike other web application vulnerabilities such as XSS and CSRF, there is no practical general solution to prevent missing or incorrect authorization checks. In this paper we propose Invariant Detector (IVD), a defense-in-depth system that automatically learns authorization rules from normal data manipulation patterns and distills them into likely invariants. These invariants, usually learned during the testing or pre-release stages of new features, are then used to block any requests that may attempt to exploit bugs in the social network's authorization logic. IVD acts as an additional layer of defense, working behind the scenes, complementary to privacy frameworks and testing. We have designed and implemented IVD to handle the unique challenges posed by modern online social networks. IVD is currently running at Facebook, where it infers and evaluates daily more than 200,000 invariants from a sample of roughly 500 million client requests, and checks the resulting invariants every second against millions of writes made to a graph database containing trillions of entities.

Detecting Homoglyph Attacks with a Siamese Neural Network,J. Woodbridge; H. S. Anderson; A. Ahuja; D. Grant,NA; NA; NA; NA,2018 IEEE Security and Privacy Workshops (SPW),6 Aug 2018,2018.0,,,22,28,"A homoglyph (name spoofing) attack is a common technique used by adversaries to obfuscate file and domain names. This technique creates process or domain names that are visually similar to legitimate and recognized names. For instance, an attacker may create malware with the name svch0st.exe so that in a visual inspection of running processes or a directory listing, the process or file name might be mistaken as the Windows system process svchost.exe. There has been limited published research on detecting homoglyph attacks. Current approaches rely on string comparison algorithms (such as Levenshtein distance) that result in computationally heavy solutions with a high number of false positives. In addition, there is a deficiency in the number of publicly available datasets for reproducible research, with most datasets focused on phishing attacks, in which homoglyphs are not always used. This paper presents a fundamentally different solution to this problem using a Siamese convolutional neural network (CNN). Rather than leveraging similarity based on character swaps and deletions, this technique uses a learned metric on strings rendered as images: a CNN learns features that are optimized to detect visual similarity of the rendered strings. The trained model is used to convert thousands of potentially targeted process or domain names to feature vectors. These feature vectors are indexed using randomized KD-Trees to make similarity searches extremely fast with minimal computational processing. This technique shows a considerable 13% to 45% improvement over baseline techniques in terms of area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC).

Existing work has explored the usage of machine learning on channel state information (CSI) computed from Wi-Fi packets to classify events of interest. However, most of these algorithms require a significant amount of data collection, as well as extensive computational power for additional CSI feature extraction. Moreover, the majority of these models suffer from poor accuracy when tested in a new/untrained environment. In this paper, we propose ReWiS, a novel framework for robust and environment-independent Wi-Fi sensing. The key innovation of ReWiS is to leverage few-shot learning (FSL) as the inference engine, which (i) reduces the need for extensive data collection and application-specific feature extraction; (ii) can rapidly generalize to new environments by leveraging only a few new samples. Moreover, ReWiS leverages multi-antenna, multi-receiver diversity, as well as fine-grained frequency resolution, to improve the overall robustness of the algorithms. Finally, we propose a technique based on singular value decomposition (SVD) to make the FSL input constant irrespective of the number of receive antennas. We prototype the ReWiS using off-the-shelf Wi-Fi equipment and showcase its performance by considering a compelling use case of human activity recognition. Thus, we perform an extensive data collection campaign in three different propagation environments with two human subjects. We evaluate the impact of each diversity component on the performance and compare ReWiS with an existing convolutional neural network (CNN)-based approach. Experimental results show that ReWiS improves the performance by about 40% with respect to existing single-antenna low-resolution approaches. Moreover, when compared to a CNN-based approach, ReWiS shows a 35% more accuracy and less than 10% drop in accuracy when tested in different environments, while the CNN drops by more than 45%.

Iliyasu,"School of Computing, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Yokohama, Japan",IEEE Access,16 Oct 2019,2019.0,7,,144451,144471,"Cellular automata (CA) is a veritable tool that provides useful insights into the intricate composition of physical systems. By exploiting this as well as the ability of CA to utilise local interactions of individual CA cells to function as a receptable for information processing, we propose a CA-based security protocol (CASP) to safeguard the integrity of QR codes. First, undertaking an extensive and conscientious study of the composition of QR codes, we propose delineating an encrypt-able area (EA) that excludes key areas needed to retain physical appearance and properties of an innocuous QR Code. Further, we adduce a zoning structure that demarcates the EA into seven zones. Our analysis shows that careful adulteration of contents of at least two zones are enough to produce encrypted versions of the QR codes. Second, each zone is partitioned into m tiles, each a 3×3 sub-block and then local interactions emanating from the occupancy (or strength) of the tiles are used to determine the composition of first-and second-tier rulesets. Third, to steer the evolution of the QR Codes, we propose the use of zone and cell-wise dextral boundary conditions (DBC) that combine a troika of cells permeating contents of a tile at state t to determine the left-most cell entry at state t+1 of its evolution. Further, we impose a pixel-wise constraint that ensures that each encrypted tile has a discordance that is no less than the in-built error correction tolerance of the code. This property guarantees adequate scrambling of the QR code to mitigate unauthorised access to it and the information it conceals. Meanwhile, considering the properties (balanced, linear and reversible) and nature of our rulesets, the proposed CASP protocol recovers QR codes that are seamlessly scannable as conduits leading authorized users to confidential information. We validated our protocol by implementing both the encryption and recovery procedures on different versions of QR Codes and our results suggest that, on average, modifications up to a minimum of 2 to 5% of any two zones of the delineated EA were enough to securely encrypt Versions 2, 3, and 4 QR Codes that were reported in the experiments; thus, rendering them unscannable and the information they conceal inaccessible. Similarly, the recovery process yields an average 97% fidelity between the original and recovered QR Codes, which is enough to restore full functionality of the codes without need for any special hardware or add-ons. Moreover, rulesets employed in our protocol are profuse, dynamic and complex, which are key properties for CA-based cryptography. This demonstrates the efficacy of our protocol as a tool to confine the transitory role of QR Codes to authorised users.",2169-3536,,10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2943754,Prince Sattam bin Abdulaziz University(grant numbers:2019/01/9862);,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8848398,Cellular automata;confidentiality;encryption;information security;QR codes;reversible computing,Protocols;Watermarking;Encryption;Information security;Media,cellular automata;cryptographic protocols;QR codes,CA-based cryptography;error correction tolerance;pixel-wise constraint;DBC;cell-wise dextral boundary conditions;EA;encrypt-able area;CA-based security protocol;cellular-automated protocol;CASP protocol;QR codes,,1.0,,72.0,CCBY,25 Sep 2019,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals,False,True,True,

The training of speaker verification requires a large amount of data, therefore users usually need to adopt third-party data (e.g., data from the Internet or third-party data company). This raises the question of whether adopting untrusted third-party data can pose a security threat. In this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to inject the hidden backdoor for infecting speaker verification models by poisoning the training data. Specifically, we design a clustering-based attack scheme where poisoned samples from different clusters will contain different triggers (i.e., pre-defined utterances), based on our understanding of verification tasks. The infected models behave normally on benign samples, while attacker-specified unenrolled triggers will successfully pass the verification even if the attacker has no information about the enrolled speaker. We also demonstrate that existing back-door attacks cannot be directly adopted in attacking speaker verification. Our approach not only provides a new perspective for designing novel attacks, but also serves as a strong baseline for improving the robustness of verification methods.

Ensuring security of facial templates is vital to circumvent impersonation and privacy invasion. One of the notable remedies for facial template protection is cancelable biometrics whereby the compromised template can be revoked and replaced. In this work, we propose a cancelable facial template technique based on the Index-of- Maximum (IoM) hashing by means of deep neural networks, termed as Deep IoM (DIoM) hashing. Unlike data-agnostic IoM hashing, the DIoM hashing is data-driven and trained by supervision to render a discriminative cancelable facial template. The DIoM hashing relies upon a permutable pretrained deep feature learning network and a hashing network responsible for optimizing the DIoM hash codes. The hashing network consolidates maxout and softmax function, namely softmaxout to approximate the discrete DIoM hash code. A dedicated loss function is designed in order to achieve similaritypreserving learning, code balancing and quantization.

Previous solutions to these tasks usually directly use the hand-crafted features or feature selection techniques for classification or regression, which usually leads to suboptimal results due to their lack of powerful representations of the hand-crafted features. To address the above problem, in this paper, we adopt the effort-aware just-in-time software defect prediction (JIT-SDP), which is a typical hand-crafted-feature-based task, as an example, to exploit new possible solutions. We propose a new model, named neural forest (NF), which uses the deep neural network and decision forest to build a holistic system for the automatic exploration of powerful feature representations that are used for the following classification. NF first employs a deep neural network to learn new feature representations from hand-crafted features. Then, a decision forest is connected after the neural network to perform classification and in the meantime, to guide the learning of feature representation. NF mainly aims at solving the challenging problem of combining the two different worlds of neural networks and decision forests in an end-to-end manner. When compared with previous state-of-the-art defect predictors and five designed baselines on six well-known benchmarks for within- and cross-project defect prediction, NF achieves significantly better results.

EC achieves this by bringing the cloud closer to edge devices. Even though EC does an excellent job of solving the latency and communication issues, it does not solve the privacy issues associated with users transferring personal data to the nearby edge server. Federated Learning (FL) is an approach that was introduced to solve the privacy issues associated with data transfers to distant servers. FL attempts to resolve this issue by bringing the code to the data, which goes against the traditional way of sending the data to remote servers. In FL, the data stays on the source device, and a Machine Learning (ML) model used to train the local data is brought to the end device instead. End devices train the ML model using local data and then send the model updates back to the server for aggregation. However, this process of asking random devices to train a model using its local data has potential risks such as a participant poisoning the model using malicious data for training to produce bogus parameters. In this paper, an approach to mitigate data poisoning attacks in a federated learning setting is investigated.

In this work, we take an architectural perspective and investigate the patterns of network architectures that are resilient to adversarial attacks. To obtain the large number of networks needed for this study, we adopt one-shot neural architecture search, training a large network for once and then finetuning the sub-networks sampled therefrom. The sampled architectures together with the accuracies they achieve provide a rich basis for our study. Our ''robust architecture Odyssey'' reveals several valuable observations: 1) densely connected patterns result in improved robustness; 2) under computational budget, adding convolution operations to direct connection edge is effective; 3) flow of solution procedure (FSP) matrix is a good indicator of network robustness. Based on these observations, we discover a family of robust architectures (RobNets). On various datasets, including CIFAR, SVHN, Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet, RobNets exhibit superior robustness performance to other widely used architectures.

The proposed authentication and symmetric key exchange algorithm are formally verified and analyzed using automated validation of Internet security protocols and applications. The result of simulation proves that the proposed scheme is secure and safe. The experimental results show that time consumption for user authentication is acceptable. The acceptance of the proposed automated user identification and authentication model is authorized using a modified technology acceptance model. The result proves that there exists a strong relationship between the perceived usefulness of items and the Attribute Of Use (AOU). It also exhibits that the association between the AOU and user satisfaction is influential. The model demonstrates that the association between the Perceived Ease Of Use and attribute towards use is weak. The influence of exogenous variables over endogenous variables exhibits that the proposed model outperforms the traditional manual system and the target users are inclined towards it.

As deep learning brings excellent performances to object detection algorithms, Tracking by Detection (TBD) has become the mainstream tracking framework. Despite the success of TBD, this two-step method is too complicated to train in an end-to-end manner and induces many challenges as well, such as insufficient exploration of video spatial-temporal information, vulnerability when facing object occlusion, and excessive reliance on detection results. To address these challenges, we propose a concise end-to-end model TubeTK which only needs one step training by introducing the ""bounding-tube"" to indicate temporal-spatial locations of objects in a short video clip. TubeTK provides a novel direction of multi-object tracking, and we demonstrate its potential to solve the above challenges without bells and whistles. We analyze the performance of TubeTK on several MOT benchmarks and provide empirical evidence to show that TubeTK has the ability to overcome occlusions to some extent without any ancillary technologies like Re-ID. Compared with other methods that adopt private detection results, our one-stage end-to-end model achieves state-of-the-art performances even if it adopts no ready-made detection results.

These embedded snippets of code in the form of malicious files or hidden within legitimate files cause a major risk to systems with their ability to run malicious command sequences. Malware authors even use polymorphism to reorder these commands and create several malicious variations. However, if executed in a secure environment, one can perform early malware detection on emulated command sequences. The models presented in this paper leverage this sequential data derived via emulation in order to perform Neural Malware Detection. These models target the core of the malicious operation by learning the presence and pattern of co-occurrence of malicious event actions from within these sequences. Our models can capture entire event sequences and be trained directly using the known target labels. These end-to-end learning models are powered by two commonly used structures - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Previously proposed sequential malware classification models process no more than 200 events. Attackers can evade detection by delaying any malicious activity beyond the beginning of the file. We present specialized models that can handle extremely long sequences while successfully performing malware detection in an efficient way.

Despite various techniques have been proposed for API-misuse detection, it is not even clear how different types of API misuses distribute and whether existing techniques have covered all major types of API misuses. Therefore, in this paper, we conduct the first large-scale empirical study on API misuses based on 528,546 historical bug-fixing commits from GitHub (from 2011 to 2018). By leveraging a state-of-the-art fine-grained AST differencing tool, GumTree, we extract more than one million bug-fixing edit operations, 51.7% of which are API misuses. We further systematically classify API misuses into nine different categories according to the edit operations and context. We also extract various frequent API-misuse patterns based on the categories and corresponding operations, which can be complementary to existing API-misuse detection tools. Our study reveals various practical guidelines regarding the importance of different types of API misuses. Furthermore, based on our dataset, we perform a user study to manually analyze the usage constraints of 10 patterns to explore whether the mined patterns can guide the design of future API-misuse detection tools. Specifically, we find that 7,541 potential misuses still exist in latest Apache projects and 149 of them have been reported to developers.

At iso-accuracy, QNNs using fewer bits require deeper and wider network architectures than networks using higher precision operators, while they require less complex arithmetic and less bits per weights. This fundamental trade-off is analyzed and quantified to find the minimum energy QNN for any benchmark and hence optimize energy-efficiency. To this end, the energy consumption of inference is modeled for a generic hardware platform. This allows drawing several conclusions across different benchmarks. First, energy consumption varies orders of magnitude at iso-accuracy depending on the number of bits used in the QNN.

Who Changed You? Obfuscator Identification for Android,Y. Wang; A.

Although obfuscation provides protection, it presents an obstacle for a number of legitimate program analyses such as detection of app cloning and repackaging, malware detection, identification of third-party libraries, provenance analysis for digital forensics, and reverse engineering for test generation and performance analysis. If the obfuscator used to create an app can be identified, and if some details of the obfuscation process can be inferred, subsequent analyses can exploit this knowledge. Thus, it is desirable to be able to automatically analyze a given app and determine (1) whether it was obfuscated, (2) which obfuscator was used, and (3) how the obfuscator was configured. We have developed novel techniques to identify the obfuscator of an Android app for several widely-used obfuscation tools and for a number of their configuration options. We define the obfuscator identification problem and propose a solution based on machine learning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to formulate and solve this problem. We identify a feature vector that represents the characteristics of the obfuscated code. We then implement a tool that extracts this feature vector from Dalvik bytecode and uses it to identify the obfuscator provenance information.

Unlike earlier approaches, which either rely on extraction of explicit feature descriptors and their classification, or fine-tuning general scene parsing deep networks for sky segmentation, our approach learns linear filters based on local structure analysis. At test time, for every candidate edge pixel, a single filter is chosen from the set of learned filters based on pixel's structure tensor, and then applied to the patch around it. We then employ dynamic programming to solve the shortest path problem for the resultant multistage graph to get the sky-mountain boundary. The proposed approach is computationally faster than earlier methods while providing comparable performance and is more suitable for resource constrained platforms e.g., mobile devices, planetary rovers and UAVs.

However, it is much harder to automate polyculture than monoculture. To facilitate research, we present AlphaGardenSim, a fast, first order, open-access polyculture farming simulator with single plant growth and irrigation models tuned using real world measurements. AlphaGardenSim can be used for policy learning as it simulates inter-plant dynamics, including light and water competition between plants in close proximity and approximates growth in a real greenhouse garden at 25, $000\times $  the speed of natural growth. This paper extends earlier work with a new action space that includes planting, which dynamically finds new seed locations that increases resources utilization, and an adaptive sampling technique to reduce the number of actions taken at each timestep without affecting performance. We also evaluate other automation policies using a novel metric that combines plant diversity and canopy coverage. Code and supplementary material can be found at https://github.com/BerkeleyAutomation/AlphaGarden. Note to Practitioners—Monoculture farming is often characterized by heavy agrichemical inputs, such as chemical fertilizers and pesticides, and increased vulnerability to disease and pestilence. This paper is motivated by the lack of long-term sustainability of industrial agriculture, and its implications for human food security. Although polyculture is a sustainable alternative to monoculture farming, it requires more human labor and is more challenging to automate. In this paper we propose a fast, first order simulator that simulates the growth of plants in a polyculture setting. Simulation experiments suggest that the simulator can be used to learn a planting, watering and pruning plan a robot can follow to produce maximal yield from a diverse set of plants with limited irrigation, however it has not yet been tested on a physical garden.

Detection of Concealed Information Using Multichannel Discriminative Dictionary and Spatial Filter Learning,A. Akhavan; M. H.

Previous studies only used the parietal channel, Pz, or at most three midline frontal, central, and parietal electrodes (Fz, Cz, and Pz); however, various observations indicate that the P300 component is distributed over a wide area on the scalp. In this paper, we propose a discriminative sparse representation model that effectively makes use of the multichannel concealed information test data. More specifically, a discriminative spatial filter is incorporated into the sparse model. Based on the proposed objective function, the elements of the model (dictionary, spatial filter and sparse code) are iteratively updated such that the discrimination power of the multichannel sparse model is improved. Furthermore, the effect of sparsity constraint on the spatial filter coefficients was investigated. In order to evaluate the performance of the multichannel model in distinguishing guilty subjects from innocent ones, 44 subjects went through a mock crime scenario, and subsequently their electroencephalography signals were recorded using eight electrodes. Experimental results show that the multichannel discriminative dictionary and spatial filter learning method was superior to other multichannel methods allowing classification of guilty and innocent participants with 95% accuracy.

Recently, modeling skeletons as spatio-temporal graphs with Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) has been reported to solidly advance the state-of-the-art performance. However, GCN-based approaches exclusively learn from raw skeleton data, and are expected to extract the inherent structural information on their own. This paper describes REGINA, introducing a novel way to REasoning Graph convolutional networks IN Human Action recognition. The rationale is to provide to the GCNs additional knowledge about the skeleton data, obtained by handcrafted features, in order to facilitate the learning process, while guaranteeing that it remains fully trainable in an end-to-end manner. The challenge is to capture complementary information over the dynamics between consecutive frames, which is the key information extracted by state-of-the-art GCN techniques. Moreover, the proposed strategy can be easily integrated in the existing GCN-based methods, which we also regard positively.

Stochastic switching of STT-MTJ provides an excellent physical randomness source. However, due to the limited technology and correlation between different process steps, process variation has a significant impact on the randomness of MTJ based TRNG.

Attacks on those web applications are also increasing. One of the common web application attacks is SQL Injection attack. These attacks are a code injection or insertion of SQL query via input data from the client to the application. There are many detection techniques implemented, but they have focused on the SQL structure at the application level. So those techniques failed to detect some of the attacks at the database level. The existing approaches use classification techniques and suitable kernel functions to detect the attack at the database level. As the SVM classification is the supervised learning algorithm, the unknown attacks can't be detected. In this paper, we propose a hybrid framework using the EDADT (Efficient Data Adaptive Decision Tree) algorithm which is the semi - supervised algorithm and SVM classification algorithm. It uses the internal query tree from the database log for good performance of framework. To get internal query tree, the query tree is converted to n - dimensional feature vector by using multi - dimensional sequence. The semantic features are used as the component of feature vector. And also the syntactic and semantic feature is used to generate multi - dimensional sequences. Then the extracted feature is converted into numeric value, if the feature contains any string value.

There are strong demands on both flexible, high-precision search and protection of privacy at peer-to-peer data retrievals. Especially, it is demanded for searching relevant files in P2P environment by using metadata while the terms in metadata that are used in such queries and annotations include some private information. In this paper, I present my current ongoing work on P2P-based semantic file sharing and retrieval mechanism that enables us to use private ontologies for flexible concept-oriented semantic searches without loss of privacy in processing semantic matchings among private metadata of files and the requested semantic queries. The private ontologies are formed on a certain reference ontology with differential ontologies for personalization. In our approach, users can manage and annotate their files with their own private ontologies. Reference ontologies are used to find out semantically relevant files for the given queries that include semantic relations among existing files and the requested files.

Data-driven decisions are taken either by humans or by software agents via analyzing streams of timeseries data coming from different running systems. Since the quality of sensed data influences the analysis and subsequent decision-making, detecting data anomalies is an important and necessary part of any data analysis and data intelligence pipeline (such as those typically found in smart and self-adaptive systems). Although a number of data science libraries exist for timeseries anomaly detection, it is both time consuming and hard to plug realtime anomaly detection functionality in existing pipelines. The problem lies with the boilerplate code that needs to be provided for common tasks such as data ingestion, data transformation and preprocessing, invoking of model re-training when needed, and persisting of identified anomalies so that they can be acted upon or further analysed. In response, we created a toolbox for realtime anomaly detection that automates the above common tasks and modularizes the anomaly detection process in a number of clearly defined components. This serves as a plug-in solution for architecting and development of smart systems that have to adapt their behavior at runtime.

Zero-shot Adversarial Quantization,Y. Liu; W. Zhang; J.

To retain the high performance of full-precision models, most existing quantization methods focus on fine-tuning quantized model by assuming training datasets are accessible. However, this assumption sometimes is not satisfied in real situations due to data privacy and security issues, thereby making these quantization methods not applicable. To achieve zero-short model quantization without accessing training data, a tiny number of quantization methods adopt either post-training quantization or batch normalization statistics-guided data generation for fine-tuning. However, both of them inevitably suffer from low performance, since the former is a little too empirical and lacks training support for ultra-low precision quantization, while the latter could not fully restore the peculiarities of original data and is often low efficient for diverse data generation. To address the above issues, we propose a zero-shot adversarial quantization (ZAQ) framework, facilitating effective discrepancy estimation and knowledge transfer from a full-precision model to its quantized model. This is achieved by a novel two-level discrepancy modeling to drive a generator to synthesize informative and diverse data examples to optimize the quantized model in an adversarial learning fashion. We conduct extensive experiments on three fundamental vision tasks, demonstrating the superiority of ZAQ over the strong zero-shot baselines and validating the effectiveness of its main components.

SDH uses ordinary least squares regression and traditional zero-one matrix encoding of class label information as the regression target (code words), thus fixing the regression target. In SDHR, the regression target is instead optimized. The optimized regression target matrix satisfies a large margin constraint for correct classification of each example. Compared with SDH, which uses the traditional zero-one matrix, SDHR utilizes the learned regression target matrix and, therefore, more accurately measures the classification error of the regression model and is more flexible.

Some solutions relying on cryptography were proposed for countering threats but these typically imply a high computational overhead.

Most of the existing works rarely take correlation of filters into account which leads to the low pruning rates of channels and operations and large accuracy loss. To address this problem, we propose two novel channel pruning methods (CCP and SCRP) based on spectral clustering, which can efficiently find the correlation between filters and compress convolution neural network without obvious accuracy loss. In CCP, we first use spectral clustering algorithm to conduct unsupervised clustering analysis on input filters. Then the reserved channels are reconstructed by calculating the intra-category average value after clustering, which minimizes the loss between the pruned model and the pre-trained model. In order to reduce the loss of information due to pruning, we do sensitivity experiments with fine-tuning to determine the reasonable pruning rate of each layer. The sensitivity test with fine-tuning can better explain the effect of pruning, rather than directly observing the loss caused by pruning. Besides, we improve our CCP for higher sparse rate: SCRP. We add a spectral clustering loss which indeed helps to achieve higher accuracy and pruning rate in FLOPs to the classification loss. For example, our pruned VGGNet-16 achieves 93.66% accuracy with 84.6% reduction in FLOPs on CIFAR-10 and 73.34% accuracy with 76.8% reduction in FLOPs on CIFAR-100 (SCRP).

Fast CNN Inference by Adaptive Sparse Matrix Decomposition,N. Tian; Y. Liu; W. Wang; D.

However, the hard threshold selection of TSVD algorithm is not suitable for the ever-changing neural network structure, and it brings about irreversible accuracy loss. To solve this problem, we propose a novel objective function, which can adaptively make CNNs sparse without hard threshold and further reduce the computation of CNNs. Specifically, different from SVD, we think the orthogonality of left and right singular matrices is unreasonable in the sparse decomposition problem. Orthogonal matrices mean that the singular vectors are unit vectors which are contrary to our goal of sparsification. Therefore, we add a L21 norm on singular vectors in order to obtain group sparsity. Besides, we use an alternative iterative method to solve the decomposed matrices automatically and the optimization is easy to implement. More importantly, the more iterations, the more sparse the model becomes. As a result, we can adaptively obtain a sparse and small CNN without specifying the sparsity rate of the big model. Finally, we test the classic CNN structures such as VGG, ResNet, WRN, DenseNet on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of our algorithm.

Various methods have been investigated extensively, but most only consider consistent rain/snow under stable background scenes. Rain/snow captured from practical surveillance camera, however, is always highly dynamic in time, and those videos also include occasionally transformed background scenes and background motions caused by waving leaves or water surfaces. To this issue, this paper proposes a novel rain/snow removal approach, which fully considers dynamic statistics of both rain/snow and background scenes taken from a video sequence. Specifically, the rain/snow is encoded as an online multi-scale convolutional sparse coding (OMS-CSC) model, which not only finely delivers the sparse scattering and multi-scale shapes of real rain/snow, but also well distinguish the components of background motion from rain/snow layer. The real-time ameliorated parameters in the model well encodes their temporally dynamic configurations. Furthermore, a transformation operator imposed on the background scenes is further embedded into the proposed model, which finely conveys the background transformations, such as rotations, scalings and distortions, inevitably existed in a real video sequence. The approach so constructed can naturally better adapt to the dynamic rain/snow as well as background changes, and also suitable to deal with the streaming video attributed its online learning mode. The proposed model is formulated in a concise maximum a posterior (MAP) framework and is readily solved by the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Compared with the state-of-the-art online and offline video rain/snow removal methods, the proposed method achieves best performance on synthetic and real videos datasets both visually and quantitatively. Specifically, our method can be implemented in relatively high efficiency, showing its potential to real-time video rain/snow removal.

However, most AT methods are in face of expensive time and computational cost for calculating gradients at multiple steps in generating adversarial examples. To boost training efficiency, fast gradient sign method (FGSM) is adopted in fast AT methods by calculating gradient only once. Unfortunately, the robustness is far from satisfactory. One reason may arise from the initialization fashion. Existing fast AT generally uses a random sample-agnostic initialization, which facilitates the efficiency yet hinders a further robustness improvement. Up to now, the initialization in fast AT is still not extensively explored. In this paper, focusing on image classification, we boost fast AT with a sample-dependent adversarial initialization, i.e., an output from a generative network conditioned on a benign image and its gradient information from the target network. As the generative network and the target network are optimized jointly in the training phase, the former can adaptively generate an effective initialization with respect to the latter, which motivates gradually improved robustness. Experimental evaluations on four benchmark databases demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over state-of-the-art fast AT methods, as well as comparable robustness to advanced multi-step AT methods.

Recent methods adopt the attention mechanism for sequence prediction which achieve convincing results. However, we argue that the existing attention mechanism faces the problem of attention diffusion, in which the model may not focus on a certain character area. In this paper, we propose Gaussian Constrained Attention Network to deal with this problem. It is a 2D attention-based method integrated with a novel Gaussian Constrained Refinement Module, which predicts an additional Gaussian mask to refine the attention weights. Different from adopting an additional supervision on the attention weights simply, our proposed method introduces an explicit refinement.

Most of the existing methods only focus on the ill-posed source-to-target task and fail to capture reasonable texture mapping. To address this problem, we propose a novel Dual-task Pose Transformer Network (DPTN), which introduces an auxiliary task (i.e., source-to-source task) and exploits the dual-task correlation to promote the performance of PGPIG. The DPTN is of a Siamese structure, containing a source-to-source self-reconstruction branch, and a transformation branch for source-to-target generation. By sharing partial weights between them, the knowledge learned by the source-to-source task can effectively assist the source-to-target learning. Furthermore, we bridge the two branches with a proposed Pose Transformer Module (PTM) to adaptively explore the correlation between features from dual tasks. Such correlation can establish the fine-grained mapping of all the pixels between the sources and the targets, and promote the source texture transmission to enhance the details of the generated target images. Extensive experiments show that our DPTN outperforms state-of-the-arts in terms of both PSNR and LPIPS. In addition, our DPTN only contains 9.79 million parameters, which is significantly smaller than other approaches.

Unlearning may also be required due to corrupted/adversarial data or simply a user's updated privacy requirement. For models which require no training (k-NN), simply deleting the closest original sample can be effective. But this idea is inapplicable to models which learn richer representations. Recent ideas leveraging optimization-based updates scale poorly with the model dimension d, due to inverting the Hessian of the loss function. We use a variant of a new conditional independence coefficient, L-CODEC, to identify a subset of the model parameters with the most semantic overlap on an individual sample level. Our approach completely avoids the need to invert a (possibly) huge matrix. By utilizing a Markov blanket selection, we premise that L-CODEC is also suitable for deep unlearning, as well as other applications in vision. Compared to alternatives, L-CODEC makes approximate unlearning possible in settings that would otherwise be infeasible, including vision models used for face recognition, person reidentification and NLP models that may require unlearning samples identified for exclusion.

Although many scholars have detected malware on X86-based Internet of Things (IoT) devices through static or dynamic analysis, these methods cannot be directly ported to X86-based IoT devices in autonomous driving because of hardware and software capabilities and real-time requirements. In this work, we propose the detection of malware on X86-based IoT devices in an autonomous driving approach combining fusion features from static analysis and machine learning to solve problems of resource overhead for dynamic analysis and low accuracy of the static analysis. First, a feature extraction model based on the level of operation code is designed. Then fusion features at three different levels are extracted through unpacking programs. Finally, a detection model based on Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) is used to discover malware on X86-based IoT devices in autonomous driving. On this basis, a malware detection approach based on fusion features is demonstrated. After that, we compare our approach with other identification approaches on a dataset consisting of 4169 samples, which includes 2379 malware and 1790 benign programs.

The proposed method integrates a simple plug-and-play module, i.e., a convolutional encoder–decoder (ED), as an augmented path to the original residual building block. Due to the abstract design and ability of the encoding stage, the decoder part tends to generate feature maps where highly semantically relevant responses are activated, while irrelevant responses are restrained. By a simple elementwise addition operation, the learned representations derived from the identity shortcut and original transformation branch are enhanced by our ED path. Furthermore, we exploit lightweight counterparts by removing a portion of channels in the original transformation branch. Fortunately, our lightweight processing does not cause an obvious performance drop but brings a computational economy. By conducting comprehensive experiments on ImageNet, MS-COCO, CUB200-2011, and CIFAR, we demonstrate the consistent accuracy gain obtained by our ED path for various residual architectures, with comparable or even lower model complexity.

To do this they iteratively refine their code, actively trying to re-use and re-purpose solutions created by other data scientists, in real time. However, recent studies have shown that a vast majority of publicly available notebooks cannot be executed out of the box. One of the prominent reasons is the deprecation of data science APIs used in such notebooks, due to the rapid evolution of data science libraries. In this work we propose RELANCER, an automatic technique that restores the executability of broken Jupyter Notebooks, in near real time, by upgrading deprecated APIs. RELANCER employs an iterative runtime-error-driven approach to identify and fix one API issue at a time. This is supported by a machine-learned model which uses the runtime error message to predict the kind of API repair needed - an update in the API or package name, a parameter, or a parameter value. Then RELANCER creates a search space of candidate repairs by combining knowledge from API migration examples on GitHub as well as the API documentation and employs a second machine-learned model to rank this space of candidate mappings. An evaluation of RELANCER on a curated dataset of 255 un-executable Jupyter Notebooks from Kaggle shows that RELANCER can successfully restore the executability of 56% of the subjects, while baselines relying on just GitHub examples and just API documentation can only fix 38% and 36% of the subjects respectively. Further, pursuant to its real-time use case, RELANCER can restore execution to 49% of subjects, within a 5 minute time limit, while a baseline lacking its machine learning models can only fix 24%.",2643-1572,978-1-6654-0337-5,10.1109/ASE51524.2021.9678889,Fujitsu; National Science Foundation; ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9678889,data science;API migration;software evolution,Runtime;Codes;Refining;Documentation;Data science;Programming;Maintenance engineering,application program interfaces;document handling;Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data,API documentation;API issue;API migration examples;API repair;automatic technique;automatic upgrade;broken Jupyter Notebooks;candidate repairs;computational notebooks;data science APIs;data science libraries;data scientists;deprecated APIs;deprecation;executability;exploratory programming;iterative runtime-error-driven approach;machine learning models;machine-learned model;prominent reasons;publicly available notebooks;re-purpose solutions;RELANCER;runtime error message;time 5.0 min;un-executable Jupyter Notebooks,,1.0,,80.0,IEEE,20 Jan 2022,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,False,True,True,

So far, developers heavily rely on obfuscation to harden their products and reduce the risk of adversarial reverse engineering. However, despite its spectacular progress, one crucial hurdle is that each of existing obfuscation method is designed specifically for obfuscating one program feature (e.g., identifier name, control flow), so an effective obfuscation scheme usually composes a considerable amount of different obfuscation methods. Therefore, one primary challenge lies in identifying effective combinations of obfuscation methods. In this research, we propose a principled technique for generating an optimal program obfuscation scheme by adopting a reinforcement learning approach. Given a program and a set of obfuscation transformations, a reinforcement learning model is progressively trained to select a sequence of obfuscation transformations, such that applying each transformation in order toward the program yields the optimal obfuscation result, making programs dissimilar while retaining reasonable instrumentation overhead.

Proposing effective Android malware detection method for preventing the spread of malware has become an emerging issue. Various features extracted through static and dynamic analysis in conjunction with machine learning algorithm have been the mainstream in largescale malware identification. In general, static analysis becomes invalid in detecting applications which adopt sophisticated obfuscation techniques like encryption or dynamic code loading. However, dynamic analysis is suitable to deal with these evasion techniques. In this paper, we propose an effective dynamic analysis framework, called EnDroid, in the aim of implementing highly precise malware detection based on multiple types of dynamic behavior features. These features cover system-level behavior trace and common application-level malicious behaviors like personal information stealing, premium service subscription, and malicious service communication. In addition, EnDroid adopts feature selection algorithm to remove noisy or irrelevant features and extracts critical behavior features.

To efficiently browse high-dimensional media, a navigational streaming model is considered: a client navigates the media space by dictating a navigation path to a server, who in response transmits the corresponding pre-encoded media data units (MDU) to the client one-by-one in sequence. Assuming that the MDU quality is pre-chosen and fixed, the problem resides in selecting and storing redundant representations of MDUs at the server in order to best trade off storage and transmission costs, while enabling adequate user’s random access. We address this problem with a landmark-based MDU optimization framework. The media space is divided into neighborhoods, each containing one landmark (a chosen MDU). MDUs in a neighborhood use the associated landmark as a predictor for inter-coding. Thus, for any MDU transition within the same neighborhood, only one inter-coded MDU transmission is required when the landmark resides in the decoder buffer. It results in lower transmission cost and enables navigational random access. To optimize an MDU structure, we employ tree-structured vector quantizer (TSVQ) to first optimize landmark locations, then iteratively add P-MDUs as refinements using a fast branch-and-bound technique. Taking interactive LF images and viewport adaptive 360° images as illustrative applications, and I-, P- and previously proposed merge frames to intra- and inter-code MDUs, we show experimentally that landmarked MDU structures can noticeably reduce the expected transmission cost compared with MDU structures without landmarks.",1558-2205,,10.1109/TCSVT.2022.3150780,"Guangdong Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:2020A1515110781); National Science Foundations of China(grant numbers:U19B2022,U1636202,61701310); NSERC(grant numbers:RGPIN-2019-06271,RGPAS-2019-00110);",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9709785,Navigational streaming;media compression;distributed source coding,Navigation;Media;Costs;Servers;Streaming media;Encoding;Videos,decoding;encoding;iterative methods;media streaming;optimisation;tree data structures;tree searching,media space;navigation path;MDU quality;transmission costs;landmark-based MDU;neighborhood use;associated landmark;MDU transition;inter-coded MDU transmission;lower transmission cost;navigational random access;MDU structure;tree-structured vector quantizer;optimize landmark locations;P-MDUs;interactive LF images;inter-code MDUs;expected transmission cost;stored high-dimensional media;modern media data;light field images;navigational streaming model;pre-encoded media data units,,,,39.0,IEEE,10 Feb 2022,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals,False,True,True,

One, in which the code and information flow are analyzed is called the static analysis, whereas, in dynamic analysis, malware behaviour is over served at runtime (by executing it in a sandbox environment). It has been observed that both techniques when used separately, fail to identify all the malware, and, an analysis based on this, fail to achieve good accuracy. There is a need to make use of both these strategies for malware identification, so, if any malignant application identification fails during the static analysis, it gets caught during the dynamic one.

Watermarking should be robust against watermark removal attacks that derive a surrogate model that evades provenance verification. Many watermarking schemes that claim robustness have been proposed, but their robustness is only validated in isolation against a relatively small set of attacks. There is no systematic, empirical evaluation of these claims against a common, comprehensive set of removal attacks. This uncertainty about a watermarking scheme’s robustness causes difficulty to trust their deployment in practice. In this paper, we evaluate whether recently proposed watermarking schemes that claim robustness are robust against a large set of removal attacks. We survey methods from the literature that (i) are known removal attacks, (ii) derive surrogate models but have not been evaluated as removal attacks, and (iii) novel removal attacks. Weight shifting and smooth retraining are novel removal attacks adapted to the DNN watermarking schemes surveyed in this paper. We propose taxonomies for watermarking schemes and removal attacks. Our empirical evaluation includes an ablation study over sets of parameters for each attack and watermarking scheme on the image classification datasets CIFAR-10 and ImageNet. Surprisingly, our study shows that none of the surveyed watermarking schemes is robust in practice. We find that schemes fail to withstand adaptive attacks and known methods for deriving surrogate models that have not been evaluated as removal attacks. This points to intrinsic flaws in how robustness is currently evaluated. Our evaluation includes a discussion of the runtime of each attack to underpin their practical relevance. While none of the schemes is robust against all attacks, none of the attacks removes all watermarks. We show that attacks can be combined and find combined attacks that remove all watermarks. We show that watermarking schemes need to be evaluated against a more extensive set of removal attacks with a more realistic adversary model.

Hierarchical Coded Gradient Aggregation for Learning at the Edge,S. Prakash; A. Reisizadeh; R. Pedarsani; A. S.

However, privacy concerns and heavy communication load make it infeasible to move the client data to a centralized location for training. In many distributed learning setups, client nodes carry out gradient computations on their local data while the central master server receives the local gradients and aggregates them to take the global model update step. To guarantee robustness against straggling communication links, we consider a hierarchical setup with ne clients and nh reliable helper nodes that are available to aid in gradient aggregation at the master. To achieve resiliency against straggling client-to-helpers links, we propose two approaches leveraging coded redundancy. First is the Aligned Repetition Coding (ARC) that repeats gradient components on the helper links, allowing significant partial aggregations at the helpers, resulting in a helpers-to-master communication load (CHM) of O(nh). ARC however results in a client-to-helpers communication load (CEH) of Θ(nh), which is prohibitive for client nodes due to limited and costly bandwidth. We thus propose Aligned Minimum Distance Separable Coding (AMC) that achieves optimal CEH of Θ(1) for a given resiliency threshold by using MDS code over the gradient components, while achieving a CHM of O(ne).",2157-8117,978-1-7281-6432-8,10.1109/ISIT44484.2020.9174077,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9174077,,,data privacy;encoding;gradient methods;learning (artificial intelligence);telecommunication computing;telecommunication links;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication security,helpers-to-master communication load;ARC;client-to-helpers communication load;MDS code;central master server;hierarchical coded gradient aggregation;distributed learning;gradient computation;communication links;coded redundancy;aligned repetition coding;aligned minimum distance separable coding;AMC,,8.0,,39.0,IEEE,24 Aug 2020,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,False,True,True,

Traditionally, categorical Medicare features are one-hot encoded for the purpose of supervised learning. One-hot encoding thousands of unique procedure codes leads to high-dimensional vectors that increase model complexity and fail to capture the inherent relationships between codes. We address these shortcomings by representing procedure codes using low-rank continuous vectors that capture various dimensions of similarity. We leverage publicly available data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, with more than 56 million claims records, and train Word2Vec models on sequences of co-occurring codes from the Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS).

Weight Decay With Tailored Adam on Scale-Invariant Weights for Better Generalization,X. Jia; X. Feng; H. Yong; D.

However, it is observed that the WD does not work effectively for an adaptive optimization algorithm (such as Adam), as it works for SGD. Specifically, the solution found by Adam with the WD often generalizes unsatisfactorily. Though efforts have been made to mitigate this issue, the reason for such deficiency is still vague. In this article, we first show that when using the Adam optimizer, the weight norm increases very fast along with the training procedure, which is in contrast to SGD where the weight norm increases relatively slower and tends to converge. The fast increase of weight norm is adverse to WD; in consequence, the Adam optimizer will lose efficacy in finding solution that generalizes well. To resolve this problem, we propose to tailor Adam by introducing a regularization term on the adaptive learning rate, such that it is friendly to WD. Meanwhile, we introduce first moment on the WD to further enhance the regularization effect. We show that the proposed method is able to find solution with small norm and generalizes better than SGD. We test the proposed method on general image classification and fine-grained image classification tasks with different networks. Experimental results on all these cases substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed method in help improving the generalization. Specifically, the proposed method improves the test accuracy of Adam by a large margin and even improves the performance of SGD by  $0.84\%$  on CIFAR 10 and  $1.03 \%$  on CIFAR 100 with ResNet-50.

However, existing works on adversarial robustness mainly focus on balanced datasets, while real-world data usually exhibits a long-tailed distribution. To push adversarial robustness towards more realistic scenarios, in this work we investigate the adversarial vulnerability as well as defense under long-tailed distributions. In particular, we first reveal the negative impacts induced by imbalanced data on both recognition performance and adversarial robustness, uncovering the intrinsic challenges of this problem. We then perform a systematic study on existing long-tailed recognition methods in conjunction with the adversarial training framework. Several valuable observations are obtained: 1) natural accuracy is relatively easy to improve, 2) fake gain of robust accuracy exists under unreliable evaluation, and 3) boundary error limits the promotion of robustness. Inspired by these observations, we propose a clean yet effective framework, RoBal, which consists of two dedicated modules, a scale-invariant classifier and data re-balancing via both margin engineering at training stage and boundary adjustment during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach over other state-of-the-art defense methods.

When it comes to real life applications of automated machines, safety is a major concern and to ensure utmost safety the unpredictable has to be taken into consideration. We propose and demonstrate a color vision approach that allows image normalization hinged on autoencoder techniques employing deep neural networks. The model is composed of image preprocessing, encoding and decoding. The images are resized in preprocessing portion the images go through a cognitive operation where the input image becomes suitable to enter the autoencoding technique section. The autoencoder is comprised of two core components – encoder and decoder. To employ this system deep neural network is applied which generates a code of an image in the encoding process. Sequentially, the code changes over to decoding. Decoder portion decodes it and regenerates the initial image extracting it from the code of the encoder portion. It allows normalizing color images under different weather conditions such as images captured during rainy or foggy weather conditions.

Intriguing Properties of Adversarial ML Attacks in the Problem Space,F. Pierazzi; F. Pendlebury; J. Cortellazzi; L.

However, the design, comparison, and real-world implications of problem-space attacks remain underexplored.This paper makes two major contributions. First, we propose a novel formalization for adversarial ML evasion attacks in the problem-space, which includes the definition of a comprehensive set of constraints on available transformations, preserved semantics, robustness to preprocessing, and plausibility. We shed light on the relationship between feature space and problem space, and we introduce the concept of side-effect features as the byproduct of the inverse feature-mapping problem. This enables us to define and prove necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of problem-space attacks. We further demonstrate the expressive power of our formalization by using it to describe several attacks from related literature across different domains.Second, building on our formalization, we propose a novel problem-space attack on Android malware that overcomes past limitations. Experiments on a dataset with 170K Android apps from 2017 and 2018 show the practical feasibility of evading a state-of-the-art malware classifier along with its hardened version. Our results demonstrate that ""adversarial-malware as a service"" is a realistic threat, as we automatically generate thousands of realistic and inconspicuous adversarial applications at scale, where on average it takes only a few minutes to generate an adversarial app. Yet, out of the 1600+ papers on adversarial ML published in the past six years, roughly 40 focus on malware [15]-and many remain only in the feature space.Our formalization of problem-space attacks paves the way to more principled research in this domain.

In this paper, we suggest that the high-level features of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks trained in visual spectra images are potentially domain independent and can be used to encode faces sensed in different image domains. A generic framework for Heterogeneous Face Recognition is proposed by adapting Deep Convolutional Neural Networks low-level features in, so-called, Domain Specific Units. The adaptation using the Domain Specific Units allows the learning of shallow feature detectors specific for each new image domain. Furthermore, it handles its transformation to a generic face space shared between all image domains.

This paper proposes 3D aided duet generative adversarial networks (AD-GAN) to precisely rotate the yaw angle of an input face image to any specified angle. AD-GAN decomposes the challenging synthesis problem into two well-constrained subtasks that correspond to a face normalizer and a face editor. The normalizer first frontalizes an input image, and then the editor rotates the frontalized image to a desired pose guided by a remote code. In the meantime, the face normalizer is designed to estimate a novel dense UV correspondence field, making our model aware of 3D face geometry information. In order to generate photo-realistic local details and accelerate convergence process, the normalizer and the editor are trained in a two-stage manner and regulated by a conditional self-cycle loss and a perceptual loss.

Multi-Weighted Co-Occurrence Descriptor Encoding for Vein Recognition,G. Wang; C. Sun; A. Sowmya,"CSIRO Data61, Epping, NSW, Australia; CSIRO, Epping, NSW, Australia; School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of New South Wales, Kensington, NSW, Australia",IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,17 Sep 2019,2020.0,15,,375,390,"Despite being highly secure, vein recognition suffers from the high inter-class similarity and intra-class variation resulting from the uncontrolled image capture, making the design of discriminative and robust representation very important. The recent success of convolutional neural network (CNN) for various image understanding tasks makes it a promising method for feature extraction. However, limited variability in small-scale datasets leads to systems derived from the direct training or fine-tuning not transferable and unreliable for practical biometric applications. This motivates the design of a multi-weighted co-occurrence descriptor encoding (MWCDE) model for vein recognition. Instead of directly conducting a feed-forward operation with a pre-trained CNN for obtaining the semantic features from the fully connected layers, co-occurrence features among convolutional filters are modeled first in MWCDE by a simple convolution between an indicator filter in a higher layer with a to-be-reweighted filter in a lower layer, and a redundancy-driven indicator filter selection algorithm is designed for filtering out some ambiguous representations. Second, another hard feature weighting strategy with a binary masking scheme is proposed for discarding noisy background and feature redundancy. The selected high-order descriptors are then embedded and aggregated into the compact feature vectors with a saliency driven spatial weighted Fisher vector algorithm, followed by the introduction of a generalized support vector machine for recognition. Extensive experiments with three benchmark vein datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework can achieve state-of-the-art results, and an additional experiment with the PolyU multispectral palmprint database illustrates its generalization ability.

Conventional methods solve the task by detecting and matching the keypoints, then estimating the pose. Recent efforts bringing deep learning into the problem mainly overcome the vulnerability of conventional methods to environmental variation due to the hand-crafted feature design. However, these methods cannot achieve end-to-end learning and good interpretability at the same time. In this letter, we propose REDE, a novel end-to-end object pose estimator using RGB-D data, which utilizes network for keypoint regression, and a differentiable geometric pose estimator for pose error back-propagation. Besides, to achieve better robustness when outlier keypoint prediction occurs, we further propose a differentiable outliers elimination method that regresses the candidate result and the confidence simultaneously. Via confidence weighted aggregation of multiple candidates, we can reduce the effect from the outliers in the final estimation. Finally, following the conventional method, we apply a learnable refinement process to further improve the estimation.

Skyfire: Data-Driven Seed Generation for Fuzzing,J. Wang; B. Chen; L. Wei; Y.

Deep bugs are often hidden in the application execution stage, and it is non-trivial to automatically generate test inputs to trigger them. Mutation-based fuzzing generates test inputs by modifying well-formed seed inputs randomly or heuristically. Most inputs are rejected at the early syntax parsing stage. Differently, generation-based fuzzing generates inputs from a specification (e.g., grammar). They can quickly carry the fuzzing beyond the syntax parsing stage. However, most inputs fail to pass the semantic checking (e.g., violating semantic rules), which restricts their capability of discovering deep bugs. In this paper, we propose a novel data-driven seed generation approach, named Skyfire, which leverages the knowledge in the vast amount of existing samples to generate well-distributed seed inputs for fuzzing programs that process highly-structured inputs. Skyfire takes as inputs a corpus and a grammar, and consists of two steps. The first step of Skyfire learns a probabilistic context-sensitive grammar (PCSG) to specify both syntax features and semantic rules, and then the second step leverages the learned PCSG to generate seed inputs. We fed the collected samples and the inputs generated by Skyfire as seeds of AFL to fuzz several open-source XSLT and XML engines (i.e., Sablotron, libxslt, and libxml2). The results have demonstrated that Skyfire can generate well-distributed inputs and thus significantly improve the code coverage (i.e., 20% for line coverage and 15% for function coverage on average) and the bug-finding capability of fuzzers. We also used the inputs generated by Skyfire to fuzz the closed-source JavaScript and rendering engine of Internet Explorer 11.

Intelligent tutoring systems are needed to improve the cyberlearning quality. One of the major difficulties is knowledge representation. The current industry standard is to use Web Ontology Language (OWL) for representing knowledge structure. But OWL only supports one ""first-class"" relation, ""is-a"", between the concepts, and different knowledge areas usually need different custom relations to describe the relations among the concepts. For example ""part-of"" and time dependency are important relations torepresent most engineering knowledge bodies. OWL has to use object properties to emulate such custom relations, leading to awkward knowledge representation hard for domain experts to code, validate and use such knowledge bases. This research uses Pace University's extension to OWL, named Knowledge Graph (KG), to support knowledge representation with custom relations. The instructors can use Pace University extended Protege IDE to declare and apply custom relations in a single document. The instructor teaching experience is also coded in the KG to better support custom learning order by students with different backgrounds.

By dealing with the perspective distortion in advance, we eliminate the need for the CNN detector to learn that. Experiments show that this approach significantly boosts the detection performance. Besides, it effectively reduces the number of training images required. In addition to the novel detection framework proposed, we also release an RGB-D dataset and source code for hazmat sign detection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work of image rectification for CNN-based object detection, and the dataset is the first public-available hazmat sign detection dataset with RGB-D sensors.",2475-8426,978-1-6654-0390-0,10.1109/SSRR50563.2020.9292601,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9292601,,Three-dimensional displays;Detectors;Robots;Hazardous materials;Training;Two dimensional displays;Task analysis,cellular neural nets;image colour analysis;image recognition;image sensors;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile robots;object detection,CNN-based planar object detection;mobile robots;RGB-D sensors;current CNN-based object detectors;large-scale training sets;long training time;planar objects;geometric information;perspective distortion;CNN detector module;detection performance;training images;CNN-based object detection;public-available hazmat sign detection dataset,,1.0,,34.0,IEEE,29 Dec 2020,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,False,True,True,

Using a single method in this way restricts the variety of scenarios in which the robot navigation system is trained and/or evaluated, thus limiting its robustness to dynamic obstacles of different speeds, trajectory smoothness, acceleration/deceleration, etc., which we call motion profiles.

CNN inference applications have been deployed in safety-critical systems, which may suffer from soft errors caused by high-energy particles, high temperature, or abnormal voltage. Of critical importance is ensuring the stability of the CNN inference process against soft errors. Traditional fault tolerance methods are not suitable for CNN inference because error-correcting code is unable to protect computational components, instruction duplication techniques incur high overhead, and existing algorithm-based fault tolerance (ABFT) techniques cannot protect all convolution implementations. In this article, we focus on how to protect the CNN inference process against soft errors as efficiently as possible, with the following three contributions.

In this paper, we propose stealthy and efficient Trojan attacks, BppAttack. Based on existing biology literature on human visual systems, we propose to use image quantization and dithering as the Trojan trigger, making imperceptible changes. It is a stealthy and efficient attack without training auxiliary models. Due to the small changes made to images, it is hard to inject such triggers during training. To alleviate this problem, we propose a contrastive learning based approach that leverages adversarial attacks to generate negative sample pairs so that the learned trigger is precise and accurate.

To date, numerous countermeasures for adversarial examples have been proposed, but how to improve the defensive ability for unknown attacks still to be answered. To address this issue, in this article, we propose an effective defense framework specified for RSI scene classification, named perturbation-seeking generative adversarial networks (PSGANs). In brief, a new training framework is designed to train the classifier by introducing the examples generated during the image reconstruction process, in addition to clean examples and adversarial ones. These generated examples can be random kinds of unknown attacks during training and thus are utilized to eliminate the blind spots of a classifier. To assist the proposed training framework, a reconstruction method is developed. First, instead of modeling the distribution of clean examples, we model the distributions of the perturbations added in adversarial examples. Second, to make a tradeoff between the diversity of the reconstructed examples and the optimization of PSGAN, a scale factor named seeking radius is introduced to scale the generated perturbations before they are subtracted by the given adversarial examples. Comprehensive and extensive experimental results on three widely used benchmarks for RSI scene classification demonstrate the great effectiveness of PSGAN when faced with both known and unknown attacks.

SFL is a recent distributed training scheme where multiple clients send intermediate activations (i. e., feature map), instead of raw data, to a central server. While such a scheme helps reduce the computational load at the client end, it opens itself to reconstruction of raw data from intermediate activation by the server. Existing works on protecting SFL only consider inference and do not handle attacks during training. So we propose ResSFL, a Split Federated Learning Framework that is designed to be MI-resistant during training. It is based on deriving a resistant feature extractor via attacker-aware training, and using this extractor to initialize the client-side model prior to standard SFL training. Such a method helps in reducing the computational complexity due to use of strong inversion model in client-side adversarial training as well as vulnerability of attacks launched in early training epochs. On CIFAR-100 dataset, our proposed framework successfully mitigates MI attack on a VGG-11 model with a high reconstruction Mean-Square-Error of 0.050 compared to 0.005 obtained by the baseline system.

In this article, we study shilling attacks where an adversarial party injects a number of fake user profiles for improper purposes. Conventional Shilling Attack approaches lack attack transferability (i.e., attacks are not effective on some victim RS models) and/or attack invisibility (i.e., injected profiles can be easily detected). To overcome these issues, we present learning to generate fake user profiles (Leg-UP), a novel attack model based on the generative adversarial network. Leg-UP learns user behavior patterns from real users in the sampled “templates” and constructs fake user profiles. To simulate real users, the generator in Leg-UP directly outputs discrete ratings. To enhance attack transferability, the parameters of the generator are optimized by maximizing the attack performance on a surrogate RS model. To improve attack invisibility, Leg-UP adopts a discriminator to guide the generator to generate undetectable fake user profiles. Experiments on benchmarks have shown that Leg-UP exceeds state-of-the-art shilling attack methods on a wide range of victim RS models.

This paper provides a framework with associated code for analyzing the impact of ReRAM device variation and post-training analog conductance quantization that has not been fully explored for pre-trained network accelerators. A detailed study with end-to-end implementation is presented, ranging from mapping the pre-trained DNN weights to quantized crossbar conductance values and into final classification with the presence of variation. Monte Carlo analysis was performed to better analyze the impact of the different parameters on the final accuracy without being device-specific. The work assumes different conductance value variations, different conductance dynamic ranges, and various device quantization levels (QLs). MNIST and CIFAR-10 data sets were used in this study for ANN and CNN, respectively. Results show that for simple ANN, the accuracy drop due to quantization was ~ 2% at 64-QLs. While for CNN, the decrease in classification accuracy was around 10% with the same number of levels. Moreover, weight variation might cause a ~ 5% and ~ 8% drop in classification accuracy for ANN with 5% and CNN with 3% variation, respectively. The study confirms that increasing the number of levels with small variation results in near-optimal accuracy. However, the increase in accuracy saturates at an upper limit. The amount of distortion propagated through the layers is different in the two cases. It is dependent on the complexity of input data and network structure, such as the size of the neurons in each layer, the number of layers, and the number of channels and filters at each stage. This contribution is the first to provide the framework to explore the implication that emphasizes on device-independent post-training DNN quantization and weight variation on classification accuracy. This helps explore design trade-offs especially for edge devices in cases where there is no access to the training set to the end-user due to security or cost issues for pre-trained networks.",2169-3536,,10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3076445,Khalifa University Competitive Internal Research Award (CIRA)(grant numbers:CIRA-2019-026); System- on-Chip Center(grant numbers:RC2-2018-020);,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9419046,Device variation;in-memory computing;neural network;post-training;quantization;ReRAM,Quantization (signal);Training;Artificial neural networks;Neural networks;Hardware;Performance evaluation;Security,artificial intelligence;logic design;Monte Carlo methods;neural nets;resistive RAM,AI inference;ReRAM-based crossbar designs;mixed-signal implementation;AI-related applications;ReRAM device variation;post-training analog conductance quantization;pre-trained network accelerators;end-to-end implementation;pre-trained DNN weights;quantized crossbar conductance values;Monte Carlo analysis;conductance value variations;device quantization levels;CIFAR-10 data sets;CNN;device-independent post-training DNN quantization;edge devices;conductance dynamic ranges,,2.0,,52.0,CCBY,29 Apr 2021,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals,False,True,True,

Scammers take advantage of the pseudo-anonymity of blockchain to implement financial fraud. The Ponzi scheme, one of the main scam methods, has defrauded investors of large amounts of money, thereby harming their interests and hindering the application of blockchain. Unfortunately, the current detection technology typically largely relies on the source code of the contract or uses a single feature which does not fully represent the contract characteristics. In such a case, the detection of Ponzi schemes with high efficiency becomes urgent. In this paper, we propose an image-based scam detection method using an attention capsule network (SE-CapsNet) focused on Ethereum. The sequence of bytecode, the opcode frequency, and the application binary interface (ABI) call are extracted as features from the contract bytecode and ABI, further converted into grayscale images, and then mapped into three color channels to generate RGB images, which are used as the input of the model for detecting the Ponzi scheme contract. In addition, we employ fancy PCA for data augmentation to reduce the impact of imbalanced data on the detection results. Experimental results show that the image-based detection method using deep learning models can effectively detect contracts before transactions occur.

Existing work suggests new algorithms and ideas as well as adjustments to the test suites to improve the effectiveness of automated fault localization. However, important questions remain open: Why is the effectiveness of these techniques so unpredictable? What are the factors that influence the effectiveness of fault localization? Can we accurately predict fault localization effectiveness?

Our analysis shows that a combination of only a few static, dynamic, and test metrics enables the construction of a prediction model with excellent discrimination power between levels of effectiveness (eight metrics yielding an AUC of .86; fifteen metrics yielding an AUC of.88). The model hence yields a practically useful confidence factor that can be used to assess the potential effectiveness of fault localization.

In this paper, we propose TadGAN, an unsupervised anomaly detection approach built on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). To capture the temporal correlations of time series distributions, we use LSTM Recurrent Neural Networks as base models for Generators and Critics. TadGAN is trained with cycle consistency loss to allow for effective time-series data reconstruction.

Most conventional maximum power point tracker (MPPT) techniques may not follow the GP under partial shading conditions (PSC). The use of metaheuristic techniques such as the bat algorithm (BA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) can overcome these obstacles. All problems inherent in the using of BA as MPPT of PV systems has been discussed and solved in this paper. The first problem is the random initial values of bats that may cause premature convergence. Therefore, the initial values of bats were modified to be close to the anticipated positions of peaks to reduce the convergence time and improve the chance of capturing the GP. The second problem occurs when shading pattern changes the value and position of the GP which is not configurable because all bats are concentrated at the previous GP; this can be resolved by BA re-initialization. The the third problem is the GP memorized in the execution of the BA code forces the PV system to work at the duty ratio of the highest GP ever seen, which may not be the real GP. This problem is solved by updating the memorized GP. This paper also proposes a new criterion for selecting the optimal swarm size against number of peaks to reduce the convergence time and improve the chance of capturing the GP. To the authors' knowledge, most of these problems inherent in the BA have hitherto not been addressed in the literature.

Although many methods have been developed to automatically test compilers, no systematic work has been conducted to detect compiler bugs when applying arbitrary optimization sequences. To resolve this problem, two main challenges need to be addressed, namely the acquisition of representative optimization sequences and the selection of representative testing programs, due to the enormous number of optimization sequences and testing programs. In this study, we propose CTOS, a novel compiler testing method based on differential testing, for detecting compiler bugs caused by optimization sequences of LLVM. CTOS first leverages the technique Doc2Vec to transform optimization sequences into vectors to capture the information of optimizations and their orders simultaneously. Second, a method based on the region graph and call relationships is developed in CTOS to construct the vector representations of the testing program, such that the semantics and the structure information of programs can be captured simultaneously. Then, with the vector representations of optimization sequences and testing programs, a “centroid” based selection scheme is proposed to address the above two challenges.

Due to blurred boundaries, low contrast, and intricate anatomical relationships between brain tissue regions, automatic brain tissue segmentation without prior knowledge is still challenging. This paper presents a novel 3D fully convolutional network (FCN) for brain tissue segmentation, called APRNet. In this network, we first propose a 3D anisotropic pyramidal convolutional reversible residual sequence (3DAPC-RRS) module to integrate the intra-slice information with the inter-slice information without significant memory consumption; secondly, we design a multi-modal cross-dimension attention (MCDA) module to automatically capture the effective information in each dimension of multi-modal images; then, we apply 3DAPC-RRS modules and MCDA modules to a 3D FCN with multiple encoded streams and one decoded stream for constituting the overall architecture of APRNet. We evaluated APRNet on two benchmark challenges, namely MRBrainS13 and iSeg-2017. The experimental results show that APRNet yields state-of-the-art segmentation results on both benchmark challenge datasets and achieves the best segmentation performance on the cerebrospinal fluid region. Compared with other methods, our proposed approach exploits the complementary information of different modalities to segment brain tissue regions in both adult and infant MR images, and it achieves the average Dice coefficient of 87.22% and 93.03% on the MRBrainS13 and iSeg-2017 testing data, respectively.

However, these warnings could be erroneous due to the defects of compiler warning diagnostics. Although the existing technique (i.e., Epiphron) can automatically generate test programs for compiler warning defect detection, the effectiveness of Epiphron on defect-finding is still limited, due to the limitation for generating warning-sensitive test program structures. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a DIversity-guided PROgram Mutation approach, called DIPROM, to construct diverse warning-sensitive programs for effective compiler warning defect detection. Given a seed test program, DIPROM first removes its dead code to reduce false positive warning defects. Then, the abstract syntax tree (AST) of the test program is constructed; DIPROM iteratively mutates the structures of the AST to generate warning-sensitive program variants. To effectively construct diverse warning-sensitive structures, DIPROM applies a novel diversity-guided strategy to generate program variants in each iteration. With the generated program variants, differential testing is conducted to detect warning defects in different compilers. In the experiments, we evaluate DIPROM with two popular C compilers (i.e., GCC and Clang). Experimental results show that DIPROM significantly outperforms three state-of-the-art approaches (i.e., HiCOND, Epiphron, and Hermes) by up to 18.93%$\sim$∼76.74% in terms of the bug-finding capability on average. Meanwhile, DIPROM is efficient, which spends less time on finding the same average number of warning defects. We at last applied DIPROM to the latest development versions of GCC and Clang.

This is due to the fact that it requires significant human participation and it is difficult to automate its sub-tasks. Therefore, there is a high demand for automatic fault localization techniques that can help software engineers effectively find the locations of faults with minimal human intervention. This has led to the proposal of implementing different types of such techniques. However, Spectrum Based Fault Localization (SBFL) is considered amongst the most prominent techniques in this respect due to its efficiency and effectiveness. In SBFL, the probability of each program element (e.g., statement, block, or function) being faulty is calculated based on the results of executing test cases and their corresponding code coverage information. However, SBFL techniques are not yet widely adopted in the industry. The rationale behind this is that they pose a number of issues and their performance is affected by several influential factors. For example, the characteristics of bugs, target programs, test suites, and supporting tools make their effectiveness differ dramatically from one case to another. There are massive studies on SBFL that cover its usage, formulas, performance, etc. So far, no dedicated survey points out comprehensively the issues of SBFL. In this paper, various SBFL challenges and issues have been identified, categorized, and discussed alongside many directions.

Among many biometric template protection (BTP) schemes, there have been studies that have attempted to protect feature vectors from the learning process of facial recognition models, while considering security requirements. One of them is secure triplet loss (STL) based BTP, which is an end-to-end BTP scheme using deep learning model that merges an additional layer on a pre-trained facial recognition model.

Sufficient evidence is sometimes measured through the availability of enough data and availability of enough signal in that data.

Federated learning (FL) is an emerging learning paradigm that enables collaborative learning among multiple clients, which can mitigate the issue of label scarcity and protect data privacy as well. Therefore, performing GraphSSC under the FL setting is a promising solution to solve real-world graph-based problems. However, existing FL methods 1) perform poorly when data across clients are non independent identically distributed (nonIID), 2) cannot handle data with new label domains, and 3) cannot leverage unlabeled data, while all these issues naturally happen in real-world graph-based problems. To address the above issues, we propose the first FL framework, namely GraphFL, for semi-supervised node classification on graphs. Our framework is motivated by meta-learning methods. Specifically, we propose two GraphFL methods to respectively address the non-IID issue in graph data and handle the tasks with new label domains. Furthermore, we design a self-training method to leverage unlabeled graph data. We adopt representative graph neural networks as GraphSSC methods and evaluate GraphFL on multiple graph datasets.

EHR activities and patient identification activities are saved in a database for accountability and tracking in the on-chain method. Edge nodes used an off-chain approach to store encrypted EHR data. As a result, the combining of on-chain and off-chain techniques only allows the authorized data user to cipher the Electronic health records and satisfy the EHR attracting increasing attention.

Can audio-visual integration strengthen robustness under multimodal attacks?,Y. Tian; C. Xu,University of Rochester; University of Rochester,2021 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR),2 Nov 2021,2021.0,,,5597,5607,"In this paper, we propose to make a systematic study on machines’ multisensory perception under attacks. We use the audio-visual event recognition task against multi-modal adversarial attacks as a proxy to investigate the robustness of audio-visual learning. We attack audio, visual, and both modalities to explore whether audio-visual integration still strengthens perception and how different fusion mechanisms affect the robustness of audio-visual models. For interpreting the multimodal interactions under attacks, we learn a weakly-supervised sound source visual localization model to localize sounding regions in videos. To mitigate multimodal attacks, we propose an audio-visual defense approach based on an audio-visual dissimilarity constraint and external feature memory banks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that audio-visual models are susceptible to multimodal adversarial attacks; audio-visual integration could decrease the model robustness rather than strengthen under multimodal attacks; even a weakly-supervised sound source visual localization model can be successfully fooled; our defense method can improve the invulnerability of audio-visual networks without significantly sacrificing clean model performance.

Although the recent automation in surveillance systems are capable of detecting the anomalies, but they still need human efforts for categorizing the anomalies and taking necessary preventive actions. This is due to the lack of methodology performing both anomaly detection and classification for real world scenarios. Thinking of a fully automatized surveillance system, which is capable of both detecting and classifying the anomalies that need immediate actions, a joint anomaly detection and classification method is a pressing need. The task of joint detection and classification of anomalies becomes challenging due to the unavailability of dense annotated videos pertaining to anomalous classes, which is a crucial factor for training modern deep architecture. Furthermore, doing it through manual human effort seems impossible. Thus, we propose a method that jointly handles the anomaly detection and classification in a single framework by adopting a weakly-supervised learning paradigm. In weakly-supervised learning instead of dense temporal annotations, only video-level labels are sufficient for learning.

However, navigators trained with limited human-annotated instructions may have difficulties in accurately capturing key information from the complicated instruction at different timesteps, leading to poor navigation performance. In this paper, we exploit to train a more robust navigator which is capable of dynamically extracting crucial factors from the long instruction, by using an adversarial attacking paradigm. Specifically, we propose a Dynamic Reinforced Instruction Attacker (DR-Attacker), which learns to mislead the navigator to move to the wrong target by destroying the most instructive information in instructions at different timesteps. By formulating the perturbation generation as a Markov Decision Process, DR-Attacker is optimized by the reinforcement learning algorithm to generate perturbed instructions sequentially during the navigation, according to a learnable attack score. Then, the perturbed instructions, which serve as hard samples, are used for improving the robustness of the navigator with an effective adversarial training strategy and an auxiliary self-supervised reasoning task. Experimental results on both Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) and Navigation from Dialog History (NDH) tasks show the superiority of our proposed method over state-of-the-art methods.

In this letter, we propose a novel framework to generate adversarial examples where the actual image is not corrupted rather its latent space representation is utilized to tamper the inherent structure of the image while maintaining the perceptual quality intact and to act as legitimate data samples. As opposed to gradient-based attacks, the latent space poisoning exploits the inclination of classifiers to model the independent and identical distribution of the training dataset and tricks it by producing out of distribution samples. We train a disentangled variational autoencoder (β-VAE) to model the data in latent space and then we add noise perturbations using a class-conditioned distribution function to the latent space under the constraint that it is misclassified to the target label.

Evaluation can be defined as looking for defense models' lower bound of robustness given a budget number of iterations and a test dataset. A practical evaluation method should be convenient (i.e., parameter-free), efficient (i.e., fewer iterations) and reliable (i.e., approaching the lower bound of robustness). Towards this target, we propose a parameter-free Adaptive Auto Attack (A3) evaluation method which addresses the efficiency and reliability in a test-time-training fashion. Specifically, by observing that adversarial examples to a specific defense model follow some regularities in their starting points, we design an Adaptive Direction Initialization strategy to speed up the evaluation. Furthermore, to approach the lower bound of robustness under the budget number of iterations, we propose an online statistics-based discarding strategy that automatically identifies and abandons hard-to-attack images. Extensive experiments on nearly 50 widely-used defense models demonstrate the effectiveness of our A3. By consuming much fewer iterations than existing methods, i.e., 1/10 on average (10× speed up), we achieve lower robust accuracy in all cases.

Although the classic numerical integration method, i.e. time-domain simulation (TDS), has been widely used in industry practice, it is inevitably trapped in a high computational complexity due to the high latitude sophistication of the power system. In this work, a data-driven power system estimation method is proposed to quickly predict the stability of the power system before TDS reaches the end of simulating time windows, which can reduce the average simulation time of stability assessment without loss of accuracy. As the topology of the power system is in the form of graph structure, graph neural network based representation learning is naturally suitable for learning the status of the power system. Motivated by observing the distribution information of crucial active power and reactive power on the power system's bus nodes, we thus propose a distribution-aware learning (DAL) module to explore an informative graph representation vector for describing the status of a power system. Then, TSA is re-defined as a binary classification task, and the stability of the system is determined directly from the resulting graph representation without numerical integration.

However, the discussion on the correlation between saliency and contour remains scarce. In this paper, we first analyze such correlation and then propose an interactive two-stream decoder to explore multiple cues, including saliency, contour and their correlation. Specifically, our decoder consists of two branches, a saliency branch and a contour branch. Each branch is assigned to learn distinctive features for predicting the corresponding map. Meanwhile, the intermediate connections are forced to learn the correlation by interactively transmitting the features from each branch to the other one. In addition, we develop an adaptive contour loss to automatically discriminate hard examples during learning process.

Recently, many recognition methods based on the encoder-decoder framework have been proposed, and they can handle scene texts of perspective distortion and curve shape. Nevertheless, they still face lots of challenges like image blur, uneven illumination, and incomplete characters. We argue that most encoder-decoder methods are based on local visual features without explicit global semantic information. In this work, we propose a semantics enhanced encoder-decoder framework to robustly recognize low-quality scene texts. The semantic information is used both in the encoder module for supervision and in the decoder module for initializing. In particular, the state-of-the-art ASTER method is integrated into the proposed framework as an exemplar.

The key challenge lies in how to learn correspondence between image and text. Existing works learn coarse correspondence based on object co-occurrence statistics, while failing to learn fine-grained phrase correspondence. In this paper, we present a novel Graph Structured Matching Network (GSMN) to learn fine-grained correspondence. The GSMN explicitly models object, relation and attribute as a structured phrase, which not only allows to learn correspondence of object, relation and attribute separately, but also benefits to learn fine-grained correspondence of structured phrase. This is achieved by node-level matching and structure-level matching. The node-level matching associates each node with its relevant nodes from another modality, where the node can be object, relation or attribute. The associated nodes then jointly infer fine-grained correspondence by fusing neighborhood associations at structure-level matching. Comprehensive experiments show that GSMN outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmarks, with relative Recall@1 improvements of nearly 7% and 2% on Flickr30K and MSCOCO, respectively.

The success of this task depends on cross-modal representation learning that projects both videos and sentences into common spaces for semantic similarity computation. In this work, we concentrate on video representation learning, an essential component for text-to-video retrieval. Inspired by the reading strategy of humans, we propose a Reading-strategy Inspired Visual Representation Learning (RIVRL) to represent videos, which consists of two branches: a previewing branch and an intensive-reading branch. The previewing branch is designed to briefly capture the overview information of videos, while the intensive-reading branch is designed to obtain more in-depth information. Moreover, the intensive-reading branch is aware of the video overview captured by the previewing branch. Such holistic information is found to be useful for the intensive-reading branch to extract more fine-grained features. Extensive experiments on three datasets are conducted, where our model RIVRL achieves a new state-of-the-art on TGIF and VATEX.

The goal is to monitor and control the software executing in the levels above their own deployment, to detect attacks or to defeat defenses. Recent antivirus solutions have gone even below the software, by enlisting hardware support. However, so far, they have only mimicked classic software techniques by monitoring software clues of an attack. As a result, malware can easily defeat them by employing metamorphic manifestation patterns. With this work, we propose a hardware-monitoring solution, SNIFFER, which tracks malware manifestations in system-level behavior, rather than code patterns, and it thus cannot be circumvented unless malware renounces its very nature, that is, to attack. SNIFFER leverages in-hardware feature monitoring, and uses machine learning to assess whether a system shows signs of an attack. Experiments with a virtual SNIFFER implementation, which supports 13 features and tests against five common network-based malicious behaviors, show that SNIFFER detects malware nearly 100% of the time, unless the malware aggressively throttle its attack.

In previous works, a number of clustering and classification techniques from machine learning and data mining have been used to classify the malwares into families and to identify even new malware families, from the behavior reports. In our work, we propose to use the Profile Hidden Markov Model to classify the malware files into families or groups based on their behavior on the host system. PHMM has been used extensively in the area of bioinformatics to search for similar protein and DNA sequences in a large database. We see that using this particular model will help us overcome the hurdle posed by polymorphism that is common in malware today. We show that the classification accuracy is high and comparable with the state-of-art-methods, even when using very few training samples for building models. The experiments were on a dataset with 24 families initially, and later using a larger dataset with close to 400 different families of malware.

However, being reliant on the local differences between neighboring pixels, they are inevitably sensitive to noise. To overcome the problem of noise-vulnerability of the conventional local structure patterns, we propose semi-local structure patterns (SLSP), a novel feature extraction method based on local region-based differences. The SLSP is robust to illumination variations, distortion, and sparse noise because it encodes the relative sizes of the central region with locally neighboring regions into a binary code. The principle of SLSP leads noise-robust expansions of LBP and MCT feature extraction frameworks. In a statistical analysis, we find that the proposed methods transform a substantial amount of random noise patterns in face images into more meaningful uniform patterns.

Skeleton-based action recognition is an attractive approach which, instead of using RGB pixel data, relies on human pose information to classify appropriate actions. However, existing algorithms often assume ideal conditions that are not representative of real-world limitations, such as noisy input, latency requirements, and edge resource constraints. To address the limitations of existing approaches, this paper presents Real-World Graph Convolution Networks (RW-GCNs), an architecture-level solution for meeting the domain constraints of Real World Skeleton-based Action Recognition. Inspired by the presence of feedback connections in the human visual cortex, RW-GCNs leverage attentive feedback augmentation on existing near state-of-the-art (SotA) Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolution Net-works (ST-GCNs). The ST-GCNs' design choices are derived from information theory-centric principles to address both the spatial and temporal noise typically encountered in end-to-end real-time and on-the-edge smart video systems. Our results demonstrate RW-GCNs' ability to serve these applications by achieving a new SotA accuracy on the NTU-RGB-D-120 dataset at 94.1%, and achieving 32× less latency than baseline ST-GCN applications while still achieving 90.4% accuracy on the Northwestern UCLA dataset in the presence of spatial keypoint noise. RW-GCNs further show system scalability by running on the 10× cost effective NVIDIA Jetson Nano (as opposed to NVIDIA Xavier NX), while still main-taining a respectful range of throughput (15.6 to 5.5 Actions per Second) on the resource constrained device.

Within the past year, masks have been used as a public health response to limit the spread of the virus. This sudden change has rendered many face recognition based access control, authentication and surveillance systems ineffective. Official documents such as passports, driving license and national identity cards are enrolled with fully uncovered face images. However, in the current global situation, face matching systems should be able to match these reference images with masked face images. As an example, in an airport or security checkpoint it is safer to match the unmasked image of the identifying document to the masked person rather than asking them to remove the mask. We find that current facial recognition techniques are not robust to this form of occlusion. To address this unique requirement presented due to the current circumstance, we propose a set of re-purposed datasets and a benchmark for researchers to use. We also propose a contrastive visual representation learning based pre-training workflow which is specialized to masked vs unmasked face matching. We ensure that our method learns robust features to differentiate people across varying data collection scenarios. We achieve this by training over many different datasets and validating our result by testing on various holdout datasets, including a real world dataset collected specifically for evaluation.

It improves upon existing face template protection techniques to provide better matching performance with one-shot and multi-shot enrollment. A key novelty of our proposed architecture is that the framework can also be used with zero-shot enrollment. This implies that our architecture does not need to be re-trained even if a new subject is to be enrolled into the system. The proposed architecture consists of two major components: a deep hashing (DH) component, which is used for robust mapping of face images to their corresponding intermediate binary codes, and a NND component, which corrects errors in the intermediate binary codes that are caused by differences in the enrollment and probe biometrics due to factors such as variation in pose, illumination, and other factors.

In recent years, several federated learning models have been proposed for training over isolated data. These models usually employ a client-server framework: 1) train local models on clients in parallel; 2) aggregate local models on the server to produce a global one. By iterating the above two steps, federated learning aims to approximate the performance of a model centrally trained on data. However, due to the non-IID data distribution issue, local models could deviate from the optimal model resulting in a biased aggregated global model. To address this problem, we propose a contractible regularization (ConTre) to act on the local model’s latent space. On each client, we first project the input data into a latent space and then pose regularization to avoid converging too fast to bad local optima. The proposed regularization can be easily integrated into existing federated learning frameworks without bringing in additional parameters. According to experimental results on multiple natural and medical image datasets, the proposed ConTre can significantly improve the performance of various federated learning frameworks.

Most vehicle retrieval algorithms are vision-based and consist of vehicle re-identification and vehicle tracking. However, the performance of vision-based vehicle retrieval algorithms is constrained as the limited information provided by traffic video streams. In this paper, we propose a contrastive cross-modal vehicle retrieval solution, maximizing the value of the complementation between natural language representation and vision representation. The framework of the proposed solution includes: (1) Preprocess a source video in four ways for generating local motional semantics and global motional semantics; (2) Correspondingly, preprocess relevant description sentences in two ways, including Textual Local Instance Semantics Extraction (TLISE) and Textual Local Motional Semantics Extraction (TLMSE); (3) Use a two-stream architecture model with four visual encoders and four text encoders to extract visual features and textual embeddings; (4) Fuse visual features and textual embeddings respectively by concatenating them along the feature channel in the order of importance, and use them for retrieval.

This overcomes many of the limitations of sensor operating systems, such as TinyOS, which do not support dynamic modification of code. Alternative schemes for network adaptation, such as networking programming, suffer from high communication cost and operational interruption.

Attackers intend to inject hidden backdoors into DNNs, such that the attacked model performs well on benign samples, whereas its prediction will be maliciously changed if hidden backdoors are activated by the attacker-defined trigger. Existing backdoor attacks usually adopt the setting that triggers are sample-agnostic, i.e., different poisoned samples contain the same trigger, resulting in that the attacks could be easily mitigated by current backdoor defenses. In this work, we explore a novel attack paradigm, where backdoor triggers are sample-specific. In our attack, we only need to modify certain training samples with invisible perturbation, while not need to manipulate other training components (e.g., training loss, and model structure) as required in many existing attacks. Specifically, inspired by the recent advance in DNN-based image steganography, we generate sample-specific invisible additive noises as backdoor triggers by encoding an attacker-specified string into benign images through an encoder-decoder network. The mapping from the string to the target label will be generated when DNNs are trained on the poisoned dataset.

However, due to the increasing awareness of personal data protection and national informat ion security regulations, most autonomous driving companies are not willing to share their private point clouds data with the community. Therefore, such restriction of centralized training might inevitably inhibit the effectiveness of RME procedure. Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning architecture that could address the aforementioned privacy-accuracy dilemma to collaboratively learn a global RME model from multiple clients without sharing raw data. In this paper, we propose a novel FedRME, a federated road markings extraction system to collaboratively learn a global RME model with multiple privacy-preserved local models from 3D mobile LiDAR point clouds. FedRME adopt the classical FedAvg model to construct a generalizable global feature embedding model without accessing local data. Moreover, to tackle data heterogeneity problem that local models vary in point clouds volumes and categories, we design a dynamic weighting mechanism to optimize the cooperative training effectiveness before server aggregation.

A large number of medical images and information is shared through a public network in these applications. This paper proposes a region-based hybrid Medical Image Watermarking (MIW) scheme to ensure the authenticity, authorization, integrity, and confidentiality of the medical images transmitted through a public network in IoMT. In the proposed scheme, medical images are partitioned into Region of Interest (RoI) and Region of Non-Interest (RoNI). To ascertain integrity of RoI, tamper detection and recovery bits are embedded in RoI in the medical image. RoI is watermarked using adaptive Least Significant Bit (LSB) substitution with respect to the hiding capacity map for higher RoI imperceptibility and accuracy in tamper detection and recovery. Electronic Patient Record (EPR) is compressed using Huffman coding and encrypted using a pseudo-random key (secret key) to provide higher confidentiality and payload. QR code of hospital logo, Encrypted EPR, and RoI recovery bits are interleaved in RoNI using Discrete Wavelet Transform-Singular Value Decomposition (DWT-SVD) hybrid transforms to achieve a robust watermark. The proposed scheme is tested under various geometric and non-geometric attacks such as filtering, compression, rotation, salt and pepper noise and shearing.

In order to do that, malware vendors employ mutation engines that transform the code of a malicious program while retaining its functionality, aiming to evade signature-based detection. These automatic processes have greatly increased the number of malware variants, deeming their fully-manual analysis impossible. Malware classification is the task of determining to which family a new malicious variant belongs. Variants of the same malware family show similar behavioral patterns. Thus, classifying newly discovered malicious programs and applications helps assess the risks they pose. Moreover, malware classification facilitates determining which of the newly discovered variants should undergo manual analysis by a security expert, in order to determine whether they belong to a new family (e.g., one whose members exploit a zero-day vulnerability) or are simply the result of a concept drift within a known malicious family. This motivated intense research in recent years on devising high-accuracy automatic tools for malware classification. In this work, we present DAEMON-a novel dataset-agnostic malware classifier. A key property of DAEMON is that the type of features it uses and the manner in which they are mined facilitate understanding the distinctive behavior of malware families, making its classification decisions explainable. We've optimized DAEMON using a large-scale dataset of ×86 binaries, belonging to a mix of several malware families targeting computers running Windows. We then re-trained it and applied it, without any algorithmic change, feature re-engineering or parameter tuning, to two other large-scale datasets of malicious Android applications consisting of numerous malware families. DAEMON obtained highly accurate classification results on all datasets, establishing that it is not only dataset-agnostic but also platform-agnostic.

Detection of adversarial examples is, therefore, a fundamental requirement for robust classification frameworks. In this work, we present a method for detecting such adversarial attacks, which is suitable for any pre-trained neural network classifier. We use influence functions to measure the impact of every training sample on the validation set data. From the influence scores, we find the most supportive training samples for any given validation example. A k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) model fitted on the DNN's activation layers is employed to search for the ranking of these supporting training samples. We observe that these samples are highly correlated with the nearest neighbors of the normal inputs, while this correlation is much weaker for adversarial inputs.

However, whether ReID inherits the vulnerability of DNNs remains unexplored. To examine the robustness of ReID systems is rather important because the insecurity of ReID systems may cause severe losses, e.g., the criminals may use the adversarial perturbations to cheat the CCTV systems. In this work, we examine the insecurity of current best-performing ReID models by proposing a learning-to-mis-rank formulation to perturb the ranking of the system output. As the cross-dataset transferability is crucial in the ReID domain, we also perform a back-box attack by developing a novel multi-stage network architecture that pyramids the features of different levels to extract general and transferable features for the adversarial perturbations. Our method can control the number of malicious pixels by using differentiable multi-shot sampling. To guarantee the inconspicuousness of the attack, we also propose a new perception loss to achieve better visual quality. Extensive experiments on four of the largest ReID benchmarks (i.e., Market1501, CUHK03, DukeMTMC, and MSMT17) not only show the effectiveness of our method, but also provides directions of the future improvement in the robustness of ReID systems. For example, the accuracy of one of the best-performing ReID systems drops sharply from 91.8% to 1.4% after being attacked by our method. Some attack results are shown in Fig. 1.

Recently, ME recognition has attracted increasing attention due to its potential applications such as clinical diagnosis, business negotiation, interrogations, and security. However, it is expensive to build large scale ME datasets, mainly due to the difficulty of inducing spontaneous MEs. This limits the application of deep learning techniques which require lots of training data. In this paper, we propose a simple, efficient yet robust descriptor called Extended Local Binary Patterns on Three Orthogonal Planes (ELBPTOP) for ME recognition. ELBPTOP consists of three complementary binary descriptors: LBPTOP and two novel ones Radial Difference LBPTOP (RDLBPTOP) and Angular Difference LBPTOP (ADLBPTOP), which explore the local second order information along the radial and angular directions contained in ME video sequences. ELBPTOP is a novel ME descriptor inspired by unique and subtle facial movements. It is computationally efficient and only marginally increases the cost of computing LBPTOP, yet is extremely effective for ME recognition. In addition, by firstly introducing Whitened Principal Component Analysis (WPCA) to ME recognition, we can further obtain more compact and discriminative feature representations, then achieve significantly computational savings. Extensive experimental evaluation on three popular spontaneous ME datasets SMIC, CASME II and SAMM show that our proposed ELBPTOP approach significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on all three single evaluated datasets and achieves promising results on cross-database recognition.

Due to the recent success of generative adversarial networks (GAN), there has been much interest in probabilistic estimation and synthetic data generation using deep neural network architectures and learning algorithms. We propose a novel sequence-to-sequence model for probabilistic human motion prediction, trained with a modified version of improved Wasserstein generative adversarial networks (WGAN-GP), in which we use a custom loss function designed for human motion prediction. Our model, which we call HP-GAN, learns a probability density function of future human poses conditioned on previous poses. It predicts multiple sequences of possible future human poses, each from the same input sequence but a different vector z drawn from a random distribution. Furthermore, to quantify the quality of the non-deterministic predictions, we simultaneously train a motion-quality-assessment model that learns the probability that a given skeleton sequence is a real human motion. We test our algorithm on two of the largest skeleton datasets: NTURGB-D and Human3.6M. We train our model on both single and multiple action types. Its predictive power for long-term motion estimation is demonstrated by generating multiple plausible futures of more than 30 frames from just 10 frames of input.

However, while the applications of human pose estimation have become more and more broad, models trained on large-scale adult pose datasets are barely successful in estimating infant poses due to the significant differences in their body ratio and the versatility of their poses. Moreover, the privacy and security considerations hinder the availability of adequate infant pose data required for training of a robust model from scratch. To address this problem, this paper presents (1) building and publicly releasing a hybrid synthetic and real infant pose (SyRIP) dataset with small yet diverse real infant images as well as generated synthetic infant poses and (2) a multi-stage invariant representation learning strategy that could transfer the knowledge from the adjacent domains of adult poses and synthetic infant images into our fine-tuned domain-adapted infant pose (FiDIP) estimation model.

To alert potential investors, DApp websites tend to mark high-risk DApps uploaded by users. So far, previous works have only trained the classifiers of smart Ponzi schemes in a unilateral way. However, smart contract dataset is very skewed, there are much fewer smart Ponzi schemes than non-Ponzi schemes. Besides, due to data security and privacy, different DApp websites are generally not allowed to share their users' data and information. As a result, it is difficult for a certain DApp website to learn the patterns of smart Ponzi schemes and detect them alone.This paper proposes a novel smart Ponzi scheme detection framework named SPSD-FL (Smart Ponzi Scheme Detection in Federated Learning) for the first time to address these problems. Instead of unilateral training, our method fulfills a secure aggregation of local gradient histograms by a horizontal federated learning based on XGBoost algorithm, in which we leverage a data augmentation method and labeled smart Ponzi schemes' code features, dapp submitters' information, and investors' information to implement the collaborative training of the detection model between different DApp websites without sharing the original training data and protecting the user's sensitive information.

Our experiments show that ontology enables merging of call graphs generated from different tools and flexible queries using a standard query interface.",,978-1-6654-7564-8,10.1109/ProTools56701.2022.00008,"LLNL(grant numbers:DE-AC52-07NA27344); National Science Foundation(grant numbers:1833332,2015254);",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10027487,Callgraph;ontology;knowledge graph;resource description framework;program analysis,Visualization;Natural languages;Merging;Ontologies;Resource description framework;Performance analysis;Safety,graph theory;ontologies (artificial intelligence);program compilers;program diagnostics;query processing,call graph information;call graph results;call graphs;caller-callee relationships;comprehensive analysis results;computer programs;formal ontology-based specification;interoperable program analyses;knowledge graphs;performance analysis;program execution;program safety;resource description framework;scalable program analyses;static program analysis,,,,18.0,IEEE,30 Jan 2023,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,False,True,True,

The search strategy of the HGSO is very simple, which results in the algorithm having poor exploitation ability and unable to find a more accurate optimal solution. The Harris Hawk optimization algorithm (HHO) has strong exploitation because of its diverse exploitation strategies. In order to make up for the shortcomings of HGSO algorithm, this article proposes an improved Henry gas solubility optimization algorithm (HHO-HGSO) based on the Harris Hawk optimization. During the iteration, taking the escaping energy function of the HHO algorithm as an indicator and determining a threshold, when the escaping energy function value is greater than the threshold, the algorithm conducts the search strategy of the HGSO algorithm, when less than the threshold, executes four exploitation strategies of Harris Hawk. In order to verify the performance of the proposed algorithm, HHO-HGSO is used to optimize CEC2005 and CEC2017 benchmark test functions and solve 4 real engineering design problems. Marine predators algorithm (MPA), Whale optimization algorithm (WOA), Lightning search algorithm (LSA), Water cycle algorithm (WCA), HGSO, and HHO were used to conduct comparative experiments.

The detection of cryptographic functions in an effective way in malware has vital significance for malicious code detection and deep analysis. Many efforts have been made to solve this issue, while existing methods suffer from some issues, such as unable to achieve promising results in accuracy, limited by prior knowledge, and have a high overhead. In this paper, we draw on the idea of text classification in the field of natural language processing and propose a novel neural network to detect the type of cryptographic functions. The new network is an end-2-end model which includes two important modules: Instruction-2-vec and K-Max-CNN-Attention. The Instruction-2-vec model extracts the “words” of assembly instructions and transfers them into continuous vectors. The K-Max-CNN-Attention is used to encode the instruction vectors and generate the representation of the function. And we designed a softmax classifier to predict the categories of the functions. Extensive experiments were conducted on a collected dataset which contains 15 common types of cryptographic functions extracted from malware, to assess the validity of the proposed approach. The experiment results showed that the proposed approach archives a better performance than the recent embedding network SAFE with the Precision, Recall and F1-score of 0.9349, 0.8933 and 0.9020, respectively.

The advent of the two-stage approach has impelled significant progress in 3D object detection. However, most available methods only can localize region proposals by a single-scale architecture network, which are sensitive to deformation and distortion. To address this issue, we propose a multi-scale convolutional neural network (MSCNN) to estimate the 3D pose of an object. To be specific, the proposed MSCNN consists of three steps for effectively detecting the distorted object on the panoramic images. The MSCNN contains the CycleGAN network that converts rectilinear images into panoramas, a fused framework that improves both accuracy and speed for object detection, and an adversarial spatial transformer network (ASTN) that extracts the deformation features of the object on panoramic images. Additionally, we recover the 3D pose of the object using a coordinate projection and a 3D bounding box. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve a 3D detection accuracy of 38.7% in high-resolution panoramic images, which is higher than the current state-of-the-art algorithm of 5.2%. Moreover, the speed of detection is only about 0.6 seconds per image, which is six times faster than Faster R-CNN (COCO).

When autonomous vehicles are sending LiDAR point clouds to deep networks for perception and planning, could the motion compensation consequently become a wide-open backdoor in those networks, due to both the adversarial vulnerability of deep learning and GPS-based vehicle trajectory estimation that is susceptible to wireless spoofing? We demonstrate such possibilities for the first time: instead of directly attacking point cloud coordinates which requires tampering with the raw LiDAR readings, only adversarial spoofing of a self-driving car’s trajectory with small perturbations is enough to make safety-critical objects undetectable or detected with incorrect positions. Moreover, polynomial trajectory perturbation is developed to achieve a temporally-smooth and highly-imperceptible attack. Extensive experiments on 3D object detection have shown that such attacks not only lower the performance of the state-of-the-art detectors effectively, but also transfer to other detectors, raising a red flag for the community.

Therefore, data transmission has become vulnerable to and unsafe from different external attacks. Every communication body wants to secure their data while communicating over the Internet. The internet has various benefits but the main demerit is the privacy and security and the transmission of data over insecure network or channel may happen. Various techniques used for secure communication in order to address these issues, steganography plays an important role. Steganography is the process of obfuscation that makes something incomprehensible and unclear. Different image steganography research methods are proposed recently but each has their advantages and disadvantages and still have necessity to develop some better image steganography mechanisms to achieve the reliability between the basics criteria of image steganography. Therefore, the proposed work, in this paper, is based on the Least Significant Bit (LSB) substitution method. The LSB substitution method can minimize the error rate in embedding process and can achieve greater reliability in criteria, using novel algorithm based on value difference. In this paper, we proposed a novel technique in steganography within the digital images such is RGB, Gray Scale, Texture, Aerial images to achieve higher security, imperceptibility, capacity, and robustness as compared with existing methods. The experimental outcomes of the suggested approach prove further developed strength and justify the feasibility of our research.

Additionally, the proposed approach achieved a 6.43 percent better score in PSNR with a variable measure of code inserted in similar images with distinct dimensions. Furthermore, encrypting the same amount of information in images of varying sizes resulted in approximately 6.77 percent improvements.

There is a remarkable decrease in efficiency when one type of contact-based sensor is employed for enrolment and another type of contact-based sensor is used for authentication (cross-matching or fingerprint sensor interoperability problem). The ridge orientation patterns in a fingerprint are invariant to the sensor type. Based on this observation, we propose a robust fingerprint descriptor called the co-occurrence of ridge orientations (Co-Ror), which encodes the spatial distribution of ridge orientations. Employing this descriptor, we introduce an efficient automatic fingerprint verification method for cross-matching problem. Furthermore, to enhance the robustness of the method, we incorporate scale-based ridge orientation information through the Gabor-HoG descriptor. The two descriptors are fused with the canonical correlation analysis (CCA), and the matching score between two fingerprints is calculated using city-block distance.
